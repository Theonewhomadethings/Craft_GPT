legs
(beige)
identify 1 stitch for the space between the legs inthe front, and 1 stitch in the back (so each leg has11 stitches). i recommend using stitch markersfor this. you might have to crochet or undo somesc so that the legs align with the head.
join the last stitch before the space between legsin the back to the first stitch after the space in thefront with a sc (this sc will be the first stitch of thefirst leg). now continue crocheting in the roundfor the first leg:
