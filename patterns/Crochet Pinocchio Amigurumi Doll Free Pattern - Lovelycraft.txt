after placed the safety eyes and completed crocheting head start filling polyester fiberfill.
use instruction images for help how to fill polyester fiberfill. complete the process by filling the head without deforming the form of head.
after that, by using flesh-color yarn the image/shape of face will be created. tie a knot tip of yarn. pass embroidery needle through behind the head and take out from under eye.
put the needle just next st and pass through the other eye. then take out the needle from under other eye and stretch the yarn to become closer two eyes then fasten the yarn. do stretching yarn process between eyes for couple times. so it will be stronger.
be careful about that: eyes shouldn't be too closed each other. try to leave 2 finger gaps between two eyes.
symmetrically sew ears between 75-77rounds at the both side of head.
do not forget follow up instruction images!
place safety eyes between rounds 73-74, and leave 8 st between two eyes.

after crochet the nose, mark the place for nose at between middle of eyes by using pins.
after that start sewing nose while filling inside nose with polyester fiberfill.
please follow up instructions images!
hair (use black yarn)
i used nako brand wool felt for pinocchio's hair. you can use another brand which you prefer for wool felt.
felting process is completely performed without preparation. if you do felting first time for amigurumi toys or need more information you can check videos which are given below.
firstly, create base part of hair. take a small amount felt to create how the hair will be placed on head place the hair on head as taking a small amount felt and start needling to create lower base of hair. fasten felt by needling felt pinches on the head without showing any flesh-color yarn. for forelock take longer felt pieces, fold in two and place left front side of head. fasten on head by needling at middle part of felt. take the felt pinch and place towards to back side of head while needling at tip part of felt. hold needling felt as vertical to shape the hair. so the shape of hair will not be stiff.
you can create your preferred hair style. just be careful about not showing or showing as much as minimum amount of flesh-color yarn through felt.
please follow instruction images! videos which are given as a list above will be helpful.
instruction images for hair
there are no any rules or orders for hair with felt.
the hair takes it shapes based on your ability. if you are not sure about how the hair looks like, do not needling intensively. because after fasten the felt on yarn, removing the felt from head will be so hard. do needling process intensively after you are sure about how hair looks like.
ps: handmade toys which are made with felt or similar material can be dangerous for young kids! they can be easily deformed or break off and can cause some accidents.
