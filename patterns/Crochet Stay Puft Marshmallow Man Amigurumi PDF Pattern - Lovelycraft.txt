assembly
the legs are fastened with a yarn, but they are not made on the side of the body, as in many toys, but from below, for this, pull the yarn from the head down with a long needle, grab the legs and pull it back, fix it.
the handles are also on the yarn fastening on the side; we yarn the yarn not from the side of the hands, but from above, where there are decreases. you can sew on.
first, we sew on the collar, and the head is already on top. i used fabric paints for the white stripes and the lettering on the cap.
