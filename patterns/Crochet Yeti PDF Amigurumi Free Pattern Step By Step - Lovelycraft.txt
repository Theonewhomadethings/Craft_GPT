helpful tips:
exact colors and brand of yarn used:
1. velvet yarn: bernat velvet yarn
2. blue: big twist cornflower blue
3. light blue: big twist light blue
4. gray: i love this yarn charcoal
5. purple: i love this yarn orchid
6. dark blue: i love this yarn blue
you can use different eye and nose sizes. you might have to adjust the placements if you change the sizes.
you can use different hook sizes and weights of yarn. it will just change the size of your yeti and you might need to adjust eye and nose placement.
how you stuff matters! the type of stuffing you use, how you stuff, all this matters on how your yeti turns out. i prefer polyfil stuffing but you can use other types.
i painted my own eyes for yeti but there are great vendors with some really great eye selections.
working on the opposite side of the chain:
this is an example picture!
start by creating your foundation chain. the amount of chains will be given in your pattern.
work the stitches given across the chain.
now, turn your work upside down into the remaining back loops of the chain stitches.
work the next stitches into the back chains across.
when you are finished, the last stitch you made will be next to your first stitch.
*the number of stitches you make on one side of the chain should be the same amount on the opposite side of the chain. depending on what you are making you may join the end of your round to the beginning with a slip stitch, or you may continue crocheting in a spiral fashion. if you are to join this will be indicated in the pattern you are making.
