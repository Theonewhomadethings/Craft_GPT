hair (with brown color)
** with the help of tape measure, we cut 60cm yarn.
if you set the yarns in the middle and do the sowing, there will be equal lengths. to adjust the boundaries of the hair, we place a marker string on the face and temporarily fix it with pins. hair transplantation process will begin to be made from these limits. seeding will continue so that no head color appears on the top. i don't give a certain number for the hair. you can add the hairstyle according to your desire. just make sure that the skin color does not appear to be obvious. after the hair transplantation process is finished, weave the ends of the tufts firmly with your brown rope. (i made 3 pieces of braids in my design) please do not forget to follow the images!
