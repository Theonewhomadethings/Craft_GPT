assembly
sew the stamens together, placing second part in the middle of first one. first, sew the center, then outside parts. sew it to the stem, grabbing only the inner loops of it.
firstly, sew 3 petals over the edge, having previously outlined their location with a "triangle" and secured with pins. then place and sew 3 more petals between them. while sewing, the petals should look up, not down.
sew the leaves, placing them face to the stem and securing with pins. stitches should be done not only at the base, but also a little higher so that the leaves do not fall.
sew the eyes between row 15 and 16 at about 8 sts apart. embroider lashes. embroider mouth in row 13. make a blush if you'd like.
congratulations, you have completed the amigurumi crocus flower pattern.
