assembly
sew the muzzle between 15 (under the eyes) and 28 rows. when a couple of cm are left to the end, fill the muzzle. sew to the end. make a face tightening. you will need a strong thread or dental floss and a long needle.
1. insert the needle into the base of the head (a) and pull it in the middle of the eye (b)
2. make a stitch to c and hook the thread from above
3. make a large stitch between the eyes and pull thread in the middle of the eye ( d)
4. make a stitch to f and hook the thread from above. pull it out at the base of the head (a)
repeat the step, but hook the thread from below. pull and tie on several knots.
sew the ears on the 7th row
sew on the corners of the muzzle for the center of the nostrils.
embroider eyelashes and eyebrows with black thread
sew the head to the body
attach the legs to the body with the a buttom attachment. take a strong thread (or dentail flass) and a long needle. insert the needle from the inside of the leg and string the button. leave the end of the thread 10-15 cm. insert the needle in the opposite direction and output to the place where we started. pierce the needle through body. repeat with the second leg the same actions as with the first. again, pierce the needle through the the body and bring the thread to the starting point.
for reliability, you can repeat the process 1-2 times. tighten the thread and tie a knot. cut the ends and hide. attach the arms in the same way
