we first start making koala amigurumi from the head.
head
1 rnd: 6 mr
2 rnd: 6 inc =12
3 rnd: (1 sc, inc)x6 times = 18
4 rnd: (2 sc, inc)x6 times = 24
5 rnd: (3 sc, inc)x6 times = 30
6 rnd: (4 sc, inc)x6 times = 36
7 rnd: (5 sc, inc)x6 times = 42
8 rnd: (6 sc, inc)x6 times = 48
9 rnd: 48
10 rnd: (7 sc, inc)x times = 54
11-14 rnd: 54
15 rnd: (8 sc, inc)x6 times = 60
16 rnd: (9 sc, inc)x6 times = 66
17-18 rnd: 66
19 rnd: (9 sc, dec)x6 times = 60
20 rnd: (8 sc, dec)x6 times = 54
21 rnd: (7 sc, dec)x6 times = 48
22 rnd: (6 sc, dec)x6 times = 42
between 14 and 15 we insert eyes next to each other at a distance of 9 st.
23 rnd: (5 sc, dec)x6 times = 6
24 rnd: (4 sc, dec)x6 times = 30
25 rnd: ( sc, dec)x6 times = 24
26 rnd: (2 sc, dec)x6 times = 18
27 rnd: (1 sc, dec)x6 times = 12
28 rnd: 6 dec
tighten the hole, cut and hide the yarn.
now we're going to make the nose. koala is quite decisive and has a large nose.
