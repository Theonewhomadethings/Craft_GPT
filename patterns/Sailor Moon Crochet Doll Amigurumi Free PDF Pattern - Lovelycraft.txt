change colors in crochet. loop your new yarn color over your hook. crochet your new yarn color back through the two loops on your hook.

crochet continuously in a spiral, unless otherwise specified.
in order to not lose track of the number of worked stitches in each round, use a stitch marker to mark the beginning of each round a thin thread of contrasting color.
crochet tightly enough so the filler is not visible through the holes between loops.
tightly and gradually fill all the details of the toy in the process of crocheting.
