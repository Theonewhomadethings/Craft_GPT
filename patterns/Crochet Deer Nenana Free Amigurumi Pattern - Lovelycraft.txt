dear friends. today i will share with you a very cute and wonderful crocheted deer amigurumi pattern. especially in winter or when christmas approaches, amigurumi patterns such as crochet deer become very popular. i am sharing a wonderful deer pattern for you on these beautiful days. before continuing with the subject, i would like to give you some information about the pattern. this deer pattern was created with 2.5mm crochet hook. you can see all the features of the yarns used in the materials section. i tried to give you enough information about this subject as much as i could to knit the amygdala. i should also say this.
it was a very difficult pattern to prepare. as you can see, even the details on the amigurumi dress are quite high. you can see tiny heart details on the yellow dress. you can also look at the pattern on my website. i am making it available for free. you can sell or use the knitted amigurumi deer doll as you wish. deer might look a little different than usual. but i think it was such a cute crochet amigurumi. do you agree? please do not forget to share my posts on your own social media profiles if you agree with me.

legs (use milky brown color and make 2)

rnd 1: start 6 sc in a magic ring (6)
rnd 2: (in) repeat 6 time (12)
rnd 3-11: sc in next 12st (12)
rnd 12: (dec) repeat 2 times, sc in next 3st, (inc) repeat 2 times, sc in next 3st (12)
rnd 13: sc in next 12st (12)
rnd 14: (dec) repeat 2 times, sc in next 3st, (inc) repeat 2 times, sc in next 3st (12)
rnd 15-26: sc in next 12st (12)
we are using a thick yarn. so you have to decide your hook size based on your crocheting. if you crochet tight, use half or 1 mm bigger size hook. if you crochet loose, use half or 1 mm smaller size hook. so you can keep the form of toy and your crochet will be neat.
first leg is finished. start second leg and crochet in the same way.
when rnd 26 is completed, continue with single crochet up to middle of round for keeping legs hallows as looking each other. do not fasten off yarn. when reach the middle of round make 6 ch and joint with other leg fill with polyester fiberfill after join legs.
we have finished crocheting the legs of the deer amigurumi. now it's time to crochet the deer's body.
body (use milky brown)
rnd 27: ch 6 and join two legs (36)
rnd 28-40: sc in next 36st (36)
rnd 41: (sc in next 4st, dec) repeat 6 times (30)
rnd 42-43: sc in next 30st (30)
rnd 44: (sc in next 3st, dec) repeat 6 times (24)
rnd 45: sc in next 24st (24)
rnd 46: (sc in next 2st, dec) repeat 6 times (18)
rnd 47-49: sc in next 18st (18)
body if finished. do not fasten off yarn and continue crocheting head.
when parts start becoming narrow, fill with polyester fiberfill as needed.
while filling with polyester fiberfill, make sure keeping the shape of toy.
if you fill too much, the shape of toy will be destroyed and it will enlarge the gap between single crochet. if you fill less, it will cause shagginess and the toy will not be firm.
after crocheting the deer's body, amigurumi will begin to form gradually.
