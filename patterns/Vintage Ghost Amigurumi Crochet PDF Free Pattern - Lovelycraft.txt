insert the safety eyes on the front of the head between rounds 8-9 and 4 visible stitches apart (see image 1)

cut yarn and fasten off. stuff the base firmly, weave the yarn tail through the front loops and pull tight to close. weave in end.
bottom "shadow' trim
hold the base upside down and attach medium grey yarn in the 2nd last front loop of round 20 (see image 2) and continue the following round in the front loops:
flo (1 sc, skip 1 stitch, 4 dc in the next stitch, skip 1 stitch) x 10
slst back into the 1st sc to finish. cut yarn, fasten off and weave in ends.
middle "shadow' trim
the scalloped edge for the middle trim will be alternated from the bottom trim (see image 3). depending on one's tension and yarn, you may need to adjust the starting stitch accordingly the starting sc needs to be in line with the 1st 4 dc in the bottom trim.
hold the base upside down and attach light grey yarn in the 1st front loop of round 18 (see image 2) and continue the following round in the front loops:
flo (1 sc, skip 1 stitch, 4 dc in the next stitch, skip 1 stitch) x 10
slst back into the 1st sc to finish. cut yarn, fasten off and weave in ends.

rnd1. inc x 35 (70)
rnd2-3. 70 sc (70)
rnd4. (slst, ch 2) x 70
slst back into the 1st slst you made to finish off. cut yarn, fasten off and weave in ends.
finishing touches
in salmon yarn or thread, embroider 2-3 lines underneath the eyes, 2 stitches long to create the blush cheek (see image 4).
in black thread, sew a simple line above the eyes over round 6, about 2 stitches long to create the eyebrows (see image 4).
we are going to crochet the hat of the amigurumi ghost pattern.
top hat
starting in charcoal yarn.
rnd1. 6 sc into mr. (6)
rnd2. inc x 6 (12)
rnd3. (1 sc, inc) x 6 (18)

colour change to maroon for the next round, leave a long starting tail but don't cut the charcoal yarn yet!
rnd9. blo 18 sc (18)
colour change back to charcoal. cut maroon yarn, fasten off and leave a long tail for sewing to the top of the head.
rnd10. flo inc x 18 (36)
rnd11. 36 slst (36)
cut yarn, fasten off invisibly and weave in end.
to create the ribbon on the hat, using 1 of the yarn tails, insert your needle through the last stitch of round 9 (see image 5), wrap the yarn around the hat and insert your needle back into the same stitch. tie a knot with the remaining tail to secure and weave in end.
once you've attached the flower to the hat, use the remaining yarn tail to sew a few stitches to secure to the ghost head.
flower
in maroon yarn.
chain 6, starting in the 3rd chain from the hook: (hdc-inc) x 2, (inc) x 2, slst back into the last chain again to finish. (9)
cut yarn, fasten off and leave a long tail for sewing.
keep the yarn tail tucked in the middle and roll into a round shape (see image 7) with the hdc on the outside to create the flower (see image 8). sew a few stitches at the bottom to secure the shape and sew to the side of the hat by the ribbon.
congratulations, you have completed the amigurumi ghost pattern.:)
