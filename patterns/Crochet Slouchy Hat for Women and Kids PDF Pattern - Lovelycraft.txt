materials
approximately 135 -150 yards size 5, bulky yarn (5oz./140g (153yd/140m)
i prefer lion brand wool ease chunky (results and gauge will vary depending on yarn used)
m13/9mm crochet hook (or size to meet gauge)
j10/6mm crochet hook (or size to meet gauge)
flexible measuring tape
tapestry needle
gauge working in the round
first 3 rounds in pattern = 3 inches with m hook
please be sure to check your gauge before starting, as tension can vary greatly from person to person and depending on the yarn used.
adjusting to meet gauge
if your gauge doesn't match, chances are your project will turn out smaller or larger than the size intended. do not get discouraged. many people crochet with different tensions, even when using the same yarn or hook size suggested. there are many adjustments that can be made to resolve this. if you continue to have problems after trying the tips below, please contact me. i am more than happy to make adjustments and offer other suggestions to make the pattern work for you. my email address is [emailprotected]
1. if the item is too small try going up a hook size or two, if it's too big go down a hook size or two.
2. when available, try working the pattern instructions for the next size up or down.
3. add or subtract increase or decrease rows/rounds. this can be tricky on certain patterns therefore, i only suggest doing this if you are comfortable in making these adjustments on your own. doing this may interfere with the remainder of the pattern, and change the stitch count throughout.
sizes
3-10 years fits head circumference 19-20.5 inches & height 7-7.5
women's one size fits most fits head circumference 21-23 inches & height 8-8.5 inches
sizes are approximate based on the average for each age. when available, please use head measurements, rather than age, as children and adult heads tend to vary quite a bit. if your child is between sizes i recommend going with the larger size to allow the most room for growth.
