embroider the nose with a rose cotton thread in rd 12. it is 3sc long. use a thin black embroidery thread to make the details around the nose.
embroider the eyebrows with a thin black embroidery thread. embroider them slightly crooked over 2 stitches starting in rd7 with a distance of 7sc in between.
if you like you can embroider rosy cheeks underneath the eyes (they are 2sc long). this free pattern is shared by lovelycraft.com with permission from the pattern owner.
if you have crocheted a hat then attach the left ear on the side of the head from rd5 to rd11. attach the hat onto the right side of the head. attach the end of the hat with a few stitches as well so that it stays bent down.
if you haven't crocheted a hat then attach the right ear iddentical to left one on the other side.
completion of the body
attach the arms slightly tilted on the side of the body (directly underneath the head).
attach the legs on the left and right side one round underneath the jumper.
attach the tail in the center of the back directly underneath the jumper.
finally embroider some details on the feet using a thin black embroidery thread (to make them look like paws).
