assembly
1) sew the head to the body.
2) sew the handles to the body (close to the head), sew the legs between 4-5 rows (you can also hem the legs on the sides so that they do not stick out).
3) sew on the muzzle. next, we sew or insert the eyes. if you sew on the eyes, like me, then we immediately make a tightening (i.e. when we sew, we pull the yarn) (see photo below) we repeat these actions 2-3 times, then we tie the remaining ends in 2-3 knots and hide yarns.
4) we embroider the whites for the eyes, the eyebrows and the nose in red.
5) sew on the ears between the 4th and 5th row, the horns between the 3rd and 4th rnd.
6) we crochet a ponytail. we attach a beige yarn to the back of the body, crochet 2 ch, and along this chain we crochet 1 slst, fasten, hide the yarn.
7) we crochet a scarf for a fawn: we dial + -30 ch, and then we crochet along this chain slst to the end of the rnd. fasten, cut the yarn.
