sleeves
attach purple yarn to remaining free loops of the 12th round of the arm (under the arm). make increases all the way, join in with slst, fasten off, hide yarn tail inside the arm.
let's crochet the long hair of the amigurumi doll
hair
using any thread or yarn in contrasting color, make a few long stitches on the head, marking the hair line. you do not need to connect it properly, this is just to help visualize the hair line, its going away after we are done with the hair. see photo.
i recommend to use pin-markers to place guide spots first.
cut a few pieces of the yarn that you chose for the hair, 225 cm long. this is the length of the hair for doll in the picture. it's extremely long, if you want it shorter, adjust the length. i recommend starting from hair
line just above forehead. here you are gong to attach the hair with every stitch. then top of the head i recommend attaching to every other round and every 2 stitches. back of the head needs even less hair, you can do every 2-3 rounds, up to 4-5 stitches apart. this is general recommendation, if you want her to have more hair, or if your hair yarn is much thinner, attach it closer together.
here is how we are going to do it:
step 1 with your crochet hook go under 1 stitch along hair line. fold piece of hair in half, and pull this loop through with your hook.
step 2 free the hook, step 1 stitch aside, and go under 1 stitch again, but this time your hook will go through the loop of previous hair piece.
fold 2nd piece of hair in half and pull it through the loop and under stitch.
step 3 pull 1st piece of hair, you will see that our very first loop disappears inside the head.
repeat until you have completed all hair. very last piece can be secured with the knot. this way we will have very natural looking hair that simply comes out of the head.
pictures below illustrate the process.
eyes (2 pcs)
following the pictures below, embroider outlines of the eyes with black and white color yarn. hide all tails inside the head after you are done.
you have completed the amigurumi rapunzel free pattern. i hope you had fun working on it!
