shape the head
fill the head with fiber after eye-stitching and crochet. get help from the visuals when filling fiber. complete the filling process with fiber without disturbing the head form.
then we will shape your face with your brown rope. knot the end of the rope. enter the lower part of the head with your needle and exit the lower part of the eye.
do the same to the other eye through the loop next to it and fix the rope by moving the two eyes closer together. tighten the rope between the two eyes several times.
this way it will be more robust.
you should pay attention to; eyes should not be too close to each other. the average between two eyes can be two fingers wide.
after the end of this process, go to the edge of the eyes with a white rope and black rope with the black rope as in the visual nose, mouth, eyebrow process. fasten the tongs to the cheeks.
if you don't have a pin, you can use a pink rope to make a line-shaped cheek.
after the head is finished, we sew two parts with the long rope we left on the body part. there will be a gap between the body and the head while joining.
fill the form with fiber and close it with stitches.
when the arms are in line 21, fill them with fiber. then leave the rope long for sewing by completing the 22nd row. after sewing the mouth part of the arms, you can start sewing to the body.
the narrow parts of the arms will be sewn on the shoulder of the body with the outward facing. i mean, it's gonna be three rows down the head.
ears; 9-10. they will stand between the rows, on both sides of the head. the ears will not be filled with fibers. connect the mouths with 6sc and erect.
please follow up the instruction images.
