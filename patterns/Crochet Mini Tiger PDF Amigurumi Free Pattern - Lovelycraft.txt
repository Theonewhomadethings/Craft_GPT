color change:
we crochet the last loop before changing the color like this:
crochet the working orange thread, pull it through the loop of the previous row, then we cling to the black thread and stretch it through the red loops (see a photo).
it turns out that we make the beginning of the column the main color, and close it already others.
we lay the thread of the main color from the wrong side so as not to make large broaches.
