hello dear friends. i've been trying to share different crochet amigurumi patterns lately. today i want to share a crochet cactus pattern again. a somewhat funny and quite simple amigurumi pattern. i especially liked the facial expression of the amigurumi. it looks so funny. normally, the name of the amigurumi was the dancing cactus amigurumi. but i don't think he looks much like a dancer. because he has a very funny look.
there is a video explanation of the construction part. if you wish, you can follow the construction steps with the video. in this way, you can make amigurumi much easier. in the final stage of crochet cactus amigurumi, you need to glue the eyes with glue. you also need to use paint for the white spots on the cactus. now let's crochet the cactus amigurumi step by step.
