tips: stuff and adjust the fiberfill, for better distribution use a sushi stick with a rectangular tip. or any other convenient stick. try to take your time and crochet tightly. this will help you to avoid gaps that can appear when stuffing and stretching a crocheted piece. almost every piece starts with the element amigurumi ring, unless otherwise indicated in the description. work in a spiral, without a seam and the details will be even and neat. finish crocheting by fixing the yarn tail with invisible join, sl st,tightening the hole or crocheting through both sides. all this i will write.
