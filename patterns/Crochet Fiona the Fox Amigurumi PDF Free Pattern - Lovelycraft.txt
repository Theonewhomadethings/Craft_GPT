hello friends. today i will share an amazing crochet fox amigurumi pattern. it's a really big and pretty well designed crochet fox pattern. don't be afraid that the fox amigurumi is big. it is a very easy pattern when you look at it as a whole, but it is an amigurumi pattern that i cannot recommend for beginners. although the crocheted fox has a fairly standard appearance, it stands out with its size.
in this way, finding and making large doll amigurumi patterns takes a lot of time. i can accept this. however, animal amigurumis are usually big. recently, amigurumi patterns such as crocheted keychains have started to be designed frequently. if you wish, you can also take a look at other amigurumi patterns. now let's crochet the fox amigurumi step by step.
