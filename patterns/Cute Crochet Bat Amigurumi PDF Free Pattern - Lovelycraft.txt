hello dear friends.
today we will crochet a very cute and magnificent bat amigurumi. a fairly new and special amigurumi pattern. it is not designed exactly as a bat and it is a design that children can love. i think the blue color is the right color for crochet bat amigurumi. you can choose light-toned colors, but i do not recommend choosing dark colors such as black.
how to make amigurumi step by step is clearly explained in the pattern. an animal amigurumi made using already very simple crochet techniques. children love this kind of doll amigurumis and their fear of animals such as bats is reduced. there is no part of this pattern that can force you. a very easy amigurumi pattern. it's pretty cool and pretty easy for beginners. now let's crochet bat amigurumi step by step.
