cuffs: hold the body upside down and crochet a sc in each flo of rnd 18 using red yarn.
assembling the head
i used a white thread for creating the eye-rim. with a colored thread (yellow in my case) add the detail below the eye.
the eyelid was embroidered with black yarn, the eyelashes with black embroidery floss.
between rnd 2 and 3, embroidered the nose with brown yarn with a with of 9 stitches. i also added some black details under the nose.
for the eyebrows, used brown yarn. they were embroidered in rnd 11 using 5 stitches, with 13 stitches between them.
you can always add cheeks below the eyes using pink yarn (width of 2 stitches).
sew the ears to the left and right of the head between the first and second round of the mane.
assembling the body
sew the head onto the body.
sew the arms to the left and right side of the body, directly below the head. make sure to allign the stripes of the arms with the ones on the t-shirt (when making yuma with a t-shirt).
sew the tail in the middle of the body, in rnd 9.
sew the legs to the left and right side of the body, in rnd 9, with a distance of 22 stitches.attach the inside of the leg to rnd 7 to avoid sticking out.
congratulations you made it!
