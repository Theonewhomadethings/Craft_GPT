dear friends, today we will make a doll amigurumi of rick character from the cartoon rick and morty. when you look at the crochet doll amigurumi pattern, you will see that it is quite easy. sometimes i share such simple amigurumi patterns for you. the doll is quite small. however, the type of yarn you will use will significantly determine the size of the doll. for example, if you want these small crochet amigurumi patterns to be larger, you can use velvet rope.
if we go back to the pattern, you start with crochet from the legs. in this way, after crocheting the body and head, you crochet the other parts and assemble all the parts. now let's crochet the rick amigurumi pattern step by step.
