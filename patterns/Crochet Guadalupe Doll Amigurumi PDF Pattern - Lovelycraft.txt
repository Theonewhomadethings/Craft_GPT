v 13. 3 sc, 1 ch and turn the fabric. from now on we are going to work in rows (back and forth, not in a spiral).
v 14-34. 34 sc, 1 ch turn the fabric.
note: the mantle can be longer or shorter depending on your tension when knitting, it may be that you need more or less rows than i mention, the correct length is 2 rounds shorter than the body of your doll.
with golden thread we must add 1 round all around. i chose to make it with crab stitch, but if you don't know how to do it, you could do it with pb. thread a needle with gold thread and embroider stars all over the mantle. (click on the link to see how the crab stitch is made)
you must have something like this:
congratulations, you have completed guadalupe doll amigurumi.
