hello my friends. how are you today?
today i prepared a very cute crochet amigurumi lion pattern for you. first of all, the pattern is suitable for beginners. in fact, it is made with the same logic as in other designs i have made. however, unlike this amigurumi, the legs are combined with buttons.
i have said before that making crochet lion amigurumi is easy. the only places you need to pay attention are the cheeks and the crochet sweater. you take care to use the right thread in cheek making. this is really important. knit the sweater as smoothly as possible. you can see the details of her hair in the amigurumi pattern. good work to you all! stay tuned for crochet patterns and free amigurumis.

sew the legs between rounds 9 and 10 of the body. to have movable legs we will use wooden buttons. thread your needle with the long yarn tail, pull your needle from one of the side sts of the first leg and pull your needle through the button hole. pull your needle through the same stitch you used before. sew the legs on the body in this way; one stitch from body and one stitch from leg.
