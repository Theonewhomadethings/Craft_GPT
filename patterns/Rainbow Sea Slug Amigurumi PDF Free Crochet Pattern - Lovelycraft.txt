hello to everyone,
the education of little children who open their eyes to the world is very important. while we buy toys for them to have fun, we should also take care that they are educational. this pattern you will make will be a great opportunity to get to know and love sea creatures.

start stuffing the body firmly
now for the eyes. stuff the body well. cut a long piece of yarn and remove the eyes. place the needle in the hole where the first eye was and thread the needle into a hole next to the eye hole. go back and forth between each eye hole repeating the process from the first eye. pull slightly on the yarn after going through each hole. do this about 3 times on each side until you reach the look you want. follow the pictures for help. there is also a youtube video i have for
extra help on this process. to place the backs of the eyes you will need to remove most of the stuffing to place the washers on the eyes then re stuff it.

you can use different eye and nose sizes. you might have to adjust the placements if you change the sizes. you can use different hook sizes and weights of yarn. it will just change the size of your slug and you might need to adjust eye and nose placement. how you stuff matters! the type of stuffing you use, how you stuff, all this matters on how your slug turns out. i prefer polyfil stuffing but you can use other types.
