dear friends, today i will share a very cute crochet keychain pattern for the winter months. when we talk about the cold, many think of siberia and today i will share a siberian tiger amigurumi pattern. no need to worry :). this is a very cute tiger and quite small. however, it is somewhat difficult to make. however, all the details are clearly stated in the description of the pattern. that's why someone who is an expert in crochet can easily do it.
many parts of amigurumi are made separately and then combined. we crochet tiger's eyes and nose with yarn. therefore, you can see the details of that part later in the article. i hope you liked today's pattern. now, if you're ready, let's crochet the tiger amigurumi step by step.
