every witch we've been taught in fairy tales has ugly big noses and creepy warts on those curved noses. moreover, they all do evil magic, either poisoning the princesses with apples or making them fall asleep for a very long time. what would you do if i told you this was all a big lie?
sabrina the witch has been the owner of a spice and herb shop in the enchanted forest for many years. everyone buys their tea, the spices that add flavor to their meals, the medicines they take when they are sick, and sometimes their potions to turn away bad luck from the lovelycraft shop.
he spends so much time with the materials in the lovelycraft shop that he can sometimes blow up the ceiling of the shop with a little magic to get some fresh air and sunshine. if you see a witch with scarlet leaves walking around, don't worry. he's probably just taken a little stroll and will be on his way back to the shop.
