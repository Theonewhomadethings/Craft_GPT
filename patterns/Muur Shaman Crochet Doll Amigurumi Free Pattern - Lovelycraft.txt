dear friends.
i always take care to develop new figures in amigurumi patterns. this cute crochet doll's name is muur! he is a shaman. it is accompanied by quite different accessories. making this cute amigurumi toy will improve you a lot.
i want to give information about the shaman, but i would like to say a few sentences so as not to distract myself. shaman is a kind of religious leader. however, our baby here is a bit of an amigurumi. she has a very different outfit. also, the figures on the amigurumi head are very cute. the richness of the accessories will make the amigurumi more impressive. there's even a crochet skull and flowers in the headband. and there is also a bone wand made of crochet. this amigurumi doll is one of my favorite amigurumi patterns. now let's move on to the step by step instructions on how to make this cute crochet shaman doll.
