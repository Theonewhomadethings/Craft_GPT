dear friends, there is no one who does not know the spongebob cartoon. i shared the spongebob amigurumi pattern in the past days and it was loved very much. it was one of the best crochet spongebob patterns, especially in recent times. today we will crochet spongebob's friend patrick amigurumi pattern. the pattern is very easy and very simple to make. by the way, the crochet patrick amigurumi pattern is completely free. i love sharing doll amigurumi patterns. patrick is one of them.
the decisive points in the pattern are the trousers and eyes. if it is difficult to crochet the eyes, you can use a different material, but i think it would be more correct to crochet the eyes. making the other parts is pretty simple. i will continue to share such patterns. now let's crochet the patrick amigurumi step by step.
