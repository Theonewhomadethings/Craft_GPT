dear friends,
hello everyone first of all. today i will share a crochet amigurumi pattern prepared using velvet yarn for you. as you know, plush crochet amigurumi is made using velvet yarn. this is how this cute crochet bunny was crocheted. it's usually not easy to crochet such an amigurumi, but i don't think you'll find it very difficult thanks to the step by step pattern instructions. therefore, i can say that it is one of the good options for beginners.
first of all, there is no dress pattern in the amigurumi pattern. i'm so sorry for this. you can contact the pattern designer for the dress. however, i think it has a very impressive appearance as it is. an extremely large amigurumi pattern. the size of the finished amigurumi crochet bunny toy will be about 40 cm. i wish you success in advance, don't forget to keep following us for new free amigurumi patterns.
