this will be a tube-like shape, that needs to be inserted into the neck after the head is filled and most of the body part is already done. do it as the leg, but it is just 14 round "tall". must be filled very firmly- seeing the filling is not an issue at this point, it is a must. if it is done as written it will prevent the head from tilting backwards. insert it into the neck after row 35 approximately half of it goes into the head and half of it stays in the body

from now on, do not do the continous spiral. turn back at the end of each row. in this way we will get a v neck. it will be removable and the bunny can be dressed in another outfit.

ball
if you make the ball orange, it can be a basketball. or stick with the white and it can be volleyball, handball, even baseball or golf ball. it will be a simple sphere, and it's detail will determine what kind of ball it is. i used textile pen to add the football/soccer ball details.
