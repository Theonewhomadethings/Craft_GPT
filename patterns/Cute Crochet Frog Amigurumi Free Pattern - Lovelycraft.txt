hello dear friends. today i want to share a cute frog pattern. actually, this is a pretty old amigurumi pattern, but it's a crochet frog pattern that hasn't been translated before. first of all, i have to say this. this is the first frog amigurumi pattern from the lovelycraft archive so far. i'm pretty excited for this. i am also very happy with the look of the amigurumi. it makes me very happy to share such beautiful amigurumi patterns and make you happy.
as for the frog, it has a body design that looks like a dress with a combination of different colors. but it looks like a real jumpsuit as the color selection is very good. this type of amigurumis appeals to beginners in general. if you are going to knit the overalls or the dress separately, then the job becomes even more difficult. now let's crochet the frog amigurumi step by step.
