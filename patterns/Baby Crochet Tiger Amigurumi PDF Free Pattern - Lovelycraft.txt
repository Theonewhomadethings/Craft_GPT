assembly
head decoration
to make everything symmetrical, we pinned the center of the belly roughly above where we made the decreases.
we mark the center above the textured white, we also mark the center of the head. to see photos.
sew the eyes between rows 15 and 16 with a distance between them of 13 sc.
based on the center of the head that we marked, we embroider the nose and the mouth.
sew the ears to the head, start sewing them between rows 3 and 4
sew the arms on row 23, with a distance of about 6 to 7 single crochets.
sew the legs to the body, between rows 9 and 10 (based on the midpoint marked on the body) with a distance of 21 sc.
sew the tail between rows 8 and 9
embroider the stripes on the head, body, legs and hands.
