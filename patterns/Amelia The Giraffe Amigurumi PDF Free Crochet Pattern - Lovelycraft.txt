assembly
head and body:
1. pin the head to the body for extra support. you may need to add more stuffing as you sew.
2. sew the head to the body.
muzzle:
1. pin the muzzle onto the face in between the eyes.
2. when you get to the last few stitches to close, add some more stuffing.
3. sew the muzzle closed.
arms:
1. pin the arms on the side of the body underneath the neck. approximately between rounds 23 and 24.
2. sew them onto the body.
tip! closing the seam by crocheting over the opening will make sewing it to the body easier. also the arms will lay nicely flat, instead of sticking out.
horns:
1. pin the horns onto the top of the head. there are no particular rounds i place them on. i try to judge based off how they look.
2. sew the horns onto the head.
legs:
1. pinch the ears at the bottom of the ear. you are going to thread your needle with the tail of the yarn. sew the 6 bottom stitches closed and about 2 stitches up the ear to close it.
2. pin the ears onto the top of the head.
3. sew the ears onto the top of the head.
tail:
1. lift up the skirt and pin the tail onto the back of the body. make sure it is lined up the way you want it.
2. sew the tail onto the body.
spots and embellishments:
1. pin the spots onto the head in random order. i randomly placed the spots all over the back of the head and 3 in the front of the head.
2. you can add some blush to the cheeks and to the inner ear if wanted with actual blush or pink crayon.
3. sew your bow onto the back of the giraffe dress if you want
helpful tips:
exact colors and brand of yarn used:
1. yellow: red heart daffodil
2. pink: i love this yarn pink
3. brown: red heart coffee
4. teal: big twist light teal
5. cream: i love this yarn ivory
you can use different eye and nose sizes. you might have to adjust the placements if you change the sizes. you can use different hook sizes and weights of yarn. it will just change the size of your giraffe and you might need to adjust eye and nose placement. how you stuff matters! the type of stuffing you use, how you stuff, all this matters on how your giraffe turns out. i prefer polyfil stuffing but you can use other types
additional information
how to make a bob or bobble stitch:
begin a double crochet in the proper stitch
yarn over and pull through so that you have 4 loops on your hook. in the next movement only take off the first 2 loops.
continue to start 3 more double crochets in the same stitch, only taking off the first 2 loops on the hook as you go. placing them together will make them bunch or puff.
keep track of how many loops you have on your hook. since we want 5, keep going til you have 6 loops on your hook. once you have six loops on your hook, yarn over and pull through all 6 loops on the hook to finish this bobble stitch off. then ch 1 and move on to the next stitches.
working on the opposite side of the chain:
this is an example picture!
start by creating your foundation chain. the amount of chains will be given in your pattern. work the stitches given across the chain. now, turn your work upside down into the remaining back loops of the chain stitches. work the next stitches into the back chains across. when you are finished, the last stitch you made will be next to your first stitch.
*the number of stitches you make on one side of the chain should be the same amount on the opposite side of the chain. depending on what you are making you may join the end of your round to the beginning with a slip stitch, or you may continue crocheting in a spiral fashion. if you are to join this will be indicated in the pattern you are making.*
