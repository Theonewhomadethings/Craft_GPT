let's make the glasses of the amigurumi pattern using fine wire.
glasses
take 1 mm craft wire, leave approximately 7 cm of wire unworked. wrap around a marker to make the first circle. swirl the wire clockwise around the marker.
leave approximately 2 cm of wire unworked in the centre to from the bridge of the glasses. make the second circle as the first one. leave approximately 7 cm of wire unworked and cut the wire. bend the wire tail toward. swirl both ends of the wire to the middle of the circle and bend to the back. swirl both end of the wire to create an ear effect. you may want to bend the middle part to adjust the glasses to your doll.
assembly
embroider the eyeliner with black sewing thread and the smile as in the image. the smile is embroidered in rnd 18-19 like a "v" shape.
place the hair diagonally to the head (not on top) so that it govers more of the back part of the head. aligh the hair separation alined with the doll's left eye.
put on the coat using a needle to help you pull the hand out. insert the needle on the first rnd of the hand and pull the hand out gently while pulling the coat to the other direction. do the same thing for the other sleeve and you are done!
