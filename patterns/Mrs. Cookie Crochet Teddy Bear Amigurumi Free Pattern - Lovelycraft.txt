shape the head
fill the head with fiber after eye engagement and closure is complete. get help from the visuals when filling fiber. completed to prepare with fiber without degrading the head form.
then we will shape your face with your milk coffee rope. knot the end of the rope. enter the lower part of the head with your needle and exit the lower part of the eye.
almost through the loop to the other eye to do the same process and close the two eyes to each other to fix the rope. do a few times while stretching with a rope between the two eyes. this way it will be more robust.
pay attention to the point you want; it shows the very close range of the eyes. two fingers between two fingers.
after this process is finished with white rope to the edge of the eyes of the half-circle design and black rope as in the visual nose, mouth, eyebrow process.
after the head is over, we sew two parts with the long rope we leave your body. there will be a gap between body and head while joining. fill the form with fiber and close it with stitches.
at 21st round start filling arm with polyester fiberfill. then finish 22nd round and join stitches to close arms. fasten off and leave a long tail to sew arms to the body.
place arms at shoulder section of body as narrow section of arms are looking towards the outside (shoulder section of body is 3 rounds below from head).
ears; planting on both sides of the head. they will stop between 8-15 rows. ears do not fill with fibers.
