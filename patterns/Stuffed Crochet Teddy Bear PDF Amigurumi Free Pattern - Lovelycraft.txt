hello everyone, friends
we have started a new week. busy working days have started again and we will miss making amigurumi. don't forget to mark the best amigurumi pattern idea that you will make with great pleasure on the weekend or in your free time.
you will love crocheting the brown plush teddy bear with thick yarn. the ear details on her head and the thin eyebrows above her plastic eyes are gorgeously done. the hand-knitted fine crochet cardigan worn on it is very compatible with the bear color. the color of the vest is slightly lighter than the color of the toy. the mouth and nose part are crocheted with frequent knitting and it looks very stylish. the crochet bear amigurumi toy is 30 cm tall and has a soft plush structure when finished.
