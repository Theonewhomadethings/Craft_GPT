let's start crocheting the amigurumi owl hedwig pattern.
wings (2x):
rd1: 5sc in mr (5)
rd2: (inc) x5 (10)
rd3: (inc) x10 (20)
rd4: (1sc, inc) x10 (30)
rd5: (2sc, inc) x10 (40)
rd6: (3sc, inc) x10 (50)
rd7: (4dc,, dc inc) x10 (60)
fold the wing in half and crochet as follows to close it: (5ch, 1 sc) x 22, crochet the last 8 stitches in sc only.
fasten off, leaving a long yarn to sew the wings on the body later.
(you can also sew them on with a cotton yarn of the same color, so that they hold better, then sew the chenille yarn).
after completing the wings of the amigurumi hedwig pattern, crochet the body and the head part. white yarn is preferred. you can change the thread color if you want. light blue or lilac yarn will look good.
head and body
start with the head:
rd1: 6sc in mr (6)
rd2: (inc) x6 (12)
rd3: (1sc, inc) x6 (18)
rd4: (2sc, inc) x6 (24)
rd5: (3sc, inc) x6 (30)
rd6: (4sc, inc) x6 (36)
rd7: 36sc (36)
rd8: (5sc, inc) x6 (42)
rd9: 42sc (42)
rd10: (6sc, inc) x6 (48)
rd11-14: 48sc (4 rounds) (48)
rd15: (6sc, dec) x6 (42)
rd16: 42sc (42)
rd17: (5sc, dec) x6 (36)
rd18: (2sc, dec) x9 (27)
rd19: (7sc, dec) x3 (24)
attach the safety eyes between rd11/12 with a distance of 7 visible stitches (the stitch marker's position is in the middle of the backside of the head) i have deepened the eyes. stuff the head firmly with fiberfill. i prefer to stuff the sides of the head a little bit more to form cheeks. try to shape the head while stuffing.
attention: do not cut the yarn yet, we will continue with the body on the next page.
continue with the body:
rd20: (3sc, inc) x6 (30)
rd21: (1sc, inc) x15 (45)
rd22: 3sc, (5sc, inc)x7 (52)
rd23: inc, 50sc, inc (54)
rd24-28: 54sc (5 rounds) (54)
rd29: (7sc, dec) x6 (48)
rd30: 48sc (48)
rd31: (6sc, dec) x6 (42)
rd32: 42sc (42)
rd34: (5sc, dec) x6 (36)
rd34: (4sc, dec) x6 (30)
rd35: (3sc, dec) x6 (24)
rd36: (2sc, dec) x6 (18)
rd37: (1sc, dec) x6 (12)
rd38: (dec) x6 (6)
stuff the body firmly with fiberfill, you can start after rd34.
cut the yarn, use a blunt needle and pull it through the 6 remaining stitches to close the hole.
sew the yarn and hide the end inside the body.
we crochet the black lines at the beginning and the part of the body of the amigurumi pattern.
completion of the head:
take a black cotton yarn and embroider the eyelashes, the lower eye rim and the eyebrows. you can embroider the pattern on the head of the owl with short lines or small "v's". you are free here in the design of your owl.
i embroidered the beak with black velvet yarn, but you can also use regular cotton. it starts in the center at the same height as the eye rim, is 3sc wide and has 2sc distance to the eye on each side. embroider a triangle and fill it out, finally embroider a beak tip.
completion of the body:
you can embroider on the belly of the owl (identical to the head before) small "v's" with black cotton yarn.
sew the wings, left and right to the back of the owl. i have fixed the wings also on the side of the belly.
let's crochet the hedwig owl amigurumi pattern scarf
scarf:
start with red color
r1: ch71
r2: crochet on the chain: hdc into the 2nd ch from the hook, 69hdc, ch2, turn
color change to yellow
r3: 70sc, ch2, turn
color change to red
r4: 70sc
finish and close your work invisibly. cut equal pieces of yarn and add them at each end of the scarf creating a tassle. cut off the excess yarn.
congratulations, you have completed the amigurumi owl hedwig pattern.
