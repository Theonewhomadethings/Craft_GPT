32. 9 sc, ch 12, skip 12 stitches and connect your chain with a sc to the next stitch, 8 sc

stop working and you will close the hole on top of the head. you can choose to close this later but i close it now because i am going to start stuffing the head.
attach color a yarn to a stitch on the top of the head tip.
1. (2 sc, dec) x 6= 18
2. (sc, dec) x 6= 12
3. dec x 6= 6
f/o and sew the hole closed
(place a stitch marker on the 1st inc and last increase of round 15)
do not stuff the tip of the head. when you are stuffing your head, pinch the tip closed to keep the stuffing from navigating to the tip.

21. sc in each st around
22. (dec, 6 ) x 6= 42
23. dec x 3, 21 sc, dec x 3, 9 sc= 36
tip! you may have to adjust the eye placement depending on yarn and hook size you use.
place your eyes between rounds 11 and 12. place the 1st eye before the 1st increase. where you placed your first stitch marker, one hole before that stitch marker. count 11 holes after that eye and place the 2nd after the last increase. stuff the head well. cut a long piece of yarn and remove the eyes. place the needle in the hole where the first eye was and thread the needle into a hole next to the eye hole. go back and forth between each eye hole repeating the process from the first eye. pull slightly on the yarn after going through each hole. do this about 3 times on each side until you reach the look you want. follow the pictures for help. there is also a youtube video i have for extra help on this process. place the backs of the eyes. you may need to remove some of the stuffing the place the backs of the eyes on. follow pictures on page 7 for help.

legs before round 15:
for round 15, sc down the side, across the front, up the side and across the back of the foot:
all parts of the amigurumi pattern are ready. now let's put the pieces together
assembly
head and body:
1. cut the shape of his mouth out with black felt. it might take a couple tries. mine did to get it the way i wanted it. i did not include a template because oogie's mouth comes in so many different shapes.
2. you can sew, hot glue or use fabric glue to put the mouth on his face. make sure the mouth is where you want it before you glue it or sew it on.
3. take a long strand of black embroidery thread. thread your needle. insert the needle into a hole on the side of the head. bring the needle up to a place on his mouth and start sewing stitches around the edges of the mouth.
arms:
1. pin the arms to the side of the body approximately between rounds 15 and 24.
2. sew the arms onto the body.
tip! closing the seam by crocheting over the opening will make sewing it to the body easier. also the arms will lay nicely flat, instead of sticking out.
legs:
1. if you want the bowtie. add it onto the oogie boogie now. you can sew it on or hot glue it onto the body.
2. pin the legs onto the front of the body approximately between rounds 41 and 51.
3. sew the legs onto the body. you may need to add stuffing as you sew.
4. weave in the tail ends.
cheeks and eyebrows:
1. cut a long strand of green yarn. thread a needle with the yarn. insert the needle into a hole in between the eyes. bring the needle to an inner corner of the eye. insert the needle into a hole on the top corner of the eye. do this approximately 3 times. repeat for the other eye.
2. i used a mini spider party favor for oogie's spider on his head. i took an embroidery strand and wrapped it around the spider making a knot. then took the other end of the strand and threaded the needle. i inserted the needle into the tip of the head and wrapped it around the head several times. weave in the ends.
stitches:
1. for the stitches on the sides. you are going to take long strands of embroidery thread and embroider stitches on each side piece of oogie. one at a time. start with a leg and continue working around each outside of limb.
helpful tips:
exact colors and brand of yarn used:
1. green: i love this yarn limelight
you can use different eye and nose sizes. you might have to adjust the placements if you change the sizes.
you can use different hook sizes and weights of yarn. it will just change the size of your oogie boogie and you might need to adjust eye and nose placement.
how you stuff matters! the type of stuffing you use, how you stuff, all this matters on how your oogie turns out. i prefer polyfil stuffing but you can use other types. here is the exact bow i used for oogie boogie link.
congratulations, you've completed the oogie boogie halloween amigurumi pattern.
merry christmas
