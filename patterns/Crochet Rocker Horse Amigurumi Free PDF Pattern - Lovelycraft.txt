friends, today i will share a cute rocking horse amigurumi pattern. the crochet rocking horse amigurumi is approximately 15cm in size. although the designer did not provide information about the materials, it seems that there is no different material used. if you wish, you can ask the person who designed the details. the general appearance of the horse is quite pleasant. really well designed and made. i think the little blue star-shaped embroideries on the crocheted horse look very cute.
although it has escaped attention, the horse's mane and tail are white. please also pay attention to this part. also, a very cute rocking chair was made for the horse. i hope you like the crochet horse amigurumi pattern. now if you are ready, let's start making this cute amigurumi.
