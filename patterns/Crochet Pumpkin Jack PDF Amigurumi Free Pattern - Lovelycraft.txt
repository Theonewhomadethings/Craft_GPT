now that we have completed the body part, we start making the pumpkin, it is explained in detail and step by step.
head tightening
the sample is shown using the example of a regular pumpkin
take a very long thread
for tightening, you need a long needle with a large eye and semi- cotton yarn in the
color of the head, pins. i have yarnart jeand. we find the last row of increases, put
a pin in each increase. we get 6 points.
we insert the needle into the lower part of the head and bring it out through the mr.
we are looking for an increase point (we have a pin there). we put the thread on this
place and insert the needle into the lower part of the head.
we withdraw the needle in the other lower part of the head. we find the second increase
with pins, put on the thread and insert the needle into the mr, and draw it out from
the bottom of the head in the next place for tightening.
now that we've crocheted a pumpkin easily, let's make the cute character's hands.
