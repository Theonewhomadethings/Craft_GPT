assembly
head and body:
1. if you crocheted the beard. place the beard approximately between rounds 27 and 28 of the body. sew the beard onto the face.
2. if you want the brushed beard look. attach a row of double stranded yarn approximately between rounds 27 and 28. you will want 18 strands of white yarn cut
approximately 6 inches in length. make one row. then repeat 2 more rows underneath that first row. brush the yarn out with a wire pet brush. you will lose a lot of yarn during this process.
nose:
1. pin the nose above your beard.
2. sew the nose onto the body.
hat:
1. pin the hat onto the head going around the nose.
2. sew the hat onto the head but not onto the nose.
arms:
1. pin the arms onto the side of the body.
2. sew the arms onto the body.
legs:
1. turn the body upside down and pin the legs onto the bottom of the body.
2. sew the legs onto the body.
cluster stitch:
begin a double crochet in the proper stitch
yarn over and pull through so that you have 4 loops on your hook. in the next movement only take off the first 2 loops.
continue to start 3 more double crochets in the same stitch, only taking off the first 2 loops on the hook as you go. placing them together will make them bunch or puff.
keep track of how many loops you have on your hook. since we want 5, keep going til you have 6 loops on your hook. once you have six loops on your hook, yarn over and pull through all 6 loops on the hook to finish this bobble stitch off. then ch 1 and move on to the next stitches.
