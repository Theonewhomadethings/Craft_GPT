let's crochet the amigurumi zombie bunny pattern pants
pants
in navy blue cotton yarn weave 44 chains and then work in a spiral. 1 to 7- the whole round of sc (44) at this point the work is divided in two to form the trouser legs. each leg is made up of 22 stitches and is worked in a spiral. for the right leg 7 equal rows are crochetted, for the left leg 9 equal rows.
when you finish crocheting each trouser leg, make a round as follows 2 sc, (2 chains, go back and crochet a half stitch over the chain and make a sl st), 3 sc, (3 chains, return and crochet 2 sc over the chains, sl st) repeat the sequence until you go all the way around. this will give the appearance of torn. at the top edge of the pants make a row of single crochets. the trouser strap is made with 60 chains.
congratulations, you have completed the amigurumi zombie bunny.
