hello my dears. today i'm going to share an amazing crochet bunny pattern for free. i tried to translate it as accurately as i could. if there is something you don't understand, you can ask me. the rabbit is quite large. you can also find how the bunny's hat and scarf are made at the end of the article. i think it's a detailed explanation. bunny amigurumi parts are made separately and then put together. this is a detail that will make your job easier. if you're ready, let's start. let's crochet the bunny amigurumi step by step.

make a pom-pom, yarn through the hole in the hat and pull it off. fasten the yarn from the pom-pom inside the hat.
assembling the toy:
sew the head to the body so that the increases and decreases are in the center. ears sew between 9 and 10 rows at the back of the head, the distance between the ears is 7 sc.
make arms and legs on a yarn mount (i made a through one so that they pressed against the body more strongly)
make a tightening on the handles to make three fingers, pull the yarn in the 4th row and stretch it through the foot to the 4th row on the other side. so repeat twice.
make a tightening on the legs to get four fingers, pull the yarn in the 3rd row and enter in the 9th. and so three times.
sew patches on the tummy, on the head and on the outside of the ear. with black iris yarn, make a few stitches on all sides of the patches for decoration.
also, embroider eyebrows and a mouth with iris (if desired, you can make a tightening of the mouth and eyes)
with brown yarn, embroider the navel with a cross in 13-15 rows. sew a tail in 7 12 rows.
congratulations! your bunny is ready.
