hello my dears. today i will share an unusual amigurumi pattern. today i will share a bunny pattern with the chick. however, it is not designed as two separate amigurumi, but as a single figure. it is quite easy to make. it is made with very basic crochet techniques. don't forget to put pink makeup on the bunny's cheeks. in addition, if you apply make-up to the inner parts of the ears in the same way, it will look much cuter. the chick is made in a standard way and is quite easy. now let's crochet the chick and bunny amigurumi step by step.
