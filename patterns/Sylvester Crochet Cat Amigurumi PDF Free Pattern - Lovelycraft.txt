black would be a good choice for color selection. however, i would prefer white color instead of yellow color. i think it is a very right choice to simply make the whiskers after making the crochet cat. such small additions add a nice air to your work. we continue to share crochet animal amigurumi patterns for free and as pdf. now let's crochet the cat amigurumi step by step.
