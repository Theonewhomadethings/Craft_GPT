did you know that in the magic forest orendo there is only one person to collect stardust? you can easily recognize him by the blue hair of the sky just before sunset and the star crown given as a gift from sirius, the brightest and hottest planet.
the night spends an entire evening collecting "stardust" from the sky. this gathering ceremony continues until the first rays of the sun greet the leaves at the top of the trees. if you're wondering where the magic in orendo comes from, these stardust are really effective. you wouldn't believe the energy of a tiny bottle. do not leave the magic forest without attending the night and the stardust collection ceremony. you will be amazed when you see how many stars in the sky. after all, we don't see that many stars from our planet.
