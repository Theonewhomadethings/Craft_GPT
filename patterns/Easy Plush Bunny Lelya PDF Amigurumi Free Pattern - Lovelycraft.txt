tightening and muzzle design
we make the tightening sequentially according to the photographs. the arrows show the direction of the needle.
we insert the needle under the muzzle, in the middle. stage 9 is the final one. we return to the starting point, pull it off, tie the yarn and hide it inside the toy. if necessary, repeat the tightening a few more times.
spout embroidery
we mark two points with pins (they can be seen in photo 3).
between 34 and 35 rows, between pins 5 sc. we embroider the nose sequentially according to the photographs. the arrows show the direction of the needle.
we insert the needle under the muzzle, in the middle. at the second stage, we bring the needle 2 sc up from the original point. at the fourth stage, we introduce the needle to the same point from where it was pulled out and return to the original point (i.e. 2 sc down).
we tie the yarn and hide it inside the toy.
