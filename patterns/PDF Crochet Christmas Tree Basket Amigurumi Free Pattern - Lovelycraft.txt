materials
your favorite worsted weight yarn in two

mc(the color of the basket)
cc(the color of the christmas tree)
5.00mm crochet hook
scissor
tapestry
needle (for weaving in ends)

stars, beans, ribbons, use your
imagination!
skill level: advanced beginner. the pattern uses the tapestry crochet technique and carries both colors of yarn along as you work. to change color, insert hook in stitch, yarn over, pull up a loop, with second color, yarn over and pull through both loops on hook.
stiches & terms
ch chain
sc single crochet
slst slip stitch
hdc half double crochet
inc increase
blo back loop only
()x times stitches in parentheses are repeated x times
csc center single crochet stitch. the csc stitch is done almost exactly like a sc, except for where you insert your hook!
it is tighter and denser than many crochet stitches, so my advice is to use a larger hook size
finished size: approximately height: 3.5(9cm), diameter of bottom:4.3(11cm)
