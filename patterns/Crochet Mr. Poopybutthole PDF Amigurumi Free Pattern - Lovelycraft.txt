hello dear friends.
today we will crochet the poopybutthole character together. once you do, you'll have a gorgeous amigurumi poopybutthole. we continue the crochet doll amigurumi patterns from where we left off. today i want to share a cartoon character. a very cute and colorful character. i'd say it's easy, but you may need to work on it a bit more as its arms and legs are very thin. you can find all the parts you see on the character in the description of the pattern.
especially after making the crochet hat of the amigurumi, you need to fix it. you should also properly fix the head to the body. in addition, the eyes of the amigurumi doll are quite striking. good luck to all of you now. now let's crochet the poopybutthole amigurumi step by step.
