friends, i haven't shared plush crochet patterns for a long time. for a while, i decided to share my posts in this direction. as you know, amigurumis made using velvet rope look very cute. they also look quite decorative for the winter months. the crocheted penguin you see in the picture can be an example of this. unfortunately, in today's crochet penguin pattern, how the hat is made is not explained. however, you can see the pattern of the tiny bow tie on the pink penguin's head in the rest of the article. now if you're ready, let's get started!
