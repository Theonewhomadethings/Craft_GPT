dear friends, would you like to crochet a cute elephant? today's crochet pattern is a cute elephant. actually, the elephant looks pretty realistic. however, the flower in her hair is unfortunately not included in the pattern. so you can find an easy flower pattern and add it. there are details in the crochet elephant pattern that i love very much. especially the fact that the inner parts of the elephant's ears are white looks very impressive. in addition, the tips of the feet are designed in white. it is not difficult to do so beginners can do it.
especially for animal amigurumi patterns, it is a little easier to make because there are not many details. i think the hardest part of the elephant is to crochet its ears. once you have successfully made the ears, the rest will be done very easily. now let's crochet the elephant amigurumi step by step.
