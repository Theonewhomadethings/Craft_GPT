hello friends. today i am going to share a very easy eeyore donkey amigurumi pattern. i shared a crochet eeyore amigurumi free pattern made using velvet yarn before. the eeyore amigurumi pattern i shared before was a pretty big model. however, this is an extremely small amigurumi doll pattern. first you will see that there are very few details. an amigurumi usually made using straight lines. i'd actually like to write a little bit about eeyore, but i don't want to get too carried away. eeyore is one of the winnie the pooh characters.
when crocheting the eeyore, you need to use a few crochet techniques. an amigurumi that is usually prepared using the easiest techniques. a very nice shade of blue is used as the color. white color was used on the nose and toes. also, a very simple tail is made. i hope you like the crochet pattern. now let's crochet eeyore amiguyum step by step.
