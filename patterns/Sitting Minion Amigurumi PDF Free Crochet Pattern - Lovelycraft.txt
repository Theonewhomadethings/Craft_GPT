let's start making amigurumi minion toy
special stitches & technique
crochet surface slip stitches
insert hook into crocheted fabric from the front to the back and place the slip knot on hook. keeping the yarn at the back, pull up the loop of the slip knot through the fabric to the front, keeping the knot at the back. insert hook in the next spot specified, from front to back. and pull up a loop through the fabric and through the loop on the hook. repeat as instructed to make the surface chain.
standing sc
first, start with a slip knot on your hook. insert your hook into the first stitch you want to work into. yarn over and pull up a loop. yarn over again and pull through both loops on your hook.
standing hdc
first, wrap the yarn around the hook 3 times. then, insert the hook into the first stitch you want to work into. pull the working end behind the piece you are working into. yarn over and pull up a loop. now you have 4 loops on the hook. then, yarn over again and pull through the first 3 loops on the hook (you may need to pull over the end of the hook with your other hand). make your next couple of regular hdc st according to the pattern. then you can let go of the tail. at the end of this step, you will already have 2 hdc.
