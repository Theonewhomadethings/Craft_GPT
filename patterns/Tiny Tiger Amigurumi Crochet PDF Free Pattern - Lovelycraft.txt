tiny tiger amigurumi crochet free pattern
the little tiger has a realistic baby tiger look with its black stripes on the orange color. the toy can fit comfortably in one palm. her hair is braided in lines on her head, and the white striped detail just below her cute face creates a realistic tiger effect. the detail of the black lines on both sides of his head has not been forgotten. the tail of the little tiger has not been forgotten, of course, it is made long like the real ones and it suits very well.
