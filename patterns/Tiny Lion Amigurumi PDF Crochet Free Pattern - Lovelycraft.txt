mane:
cut the orange yarn into pieces of approximately the same length (you can wind it on a piece of cardboard of the desired width and then cut it). mark the line of mane on the head with pins and then thread the yarn sections along the marked line, removing the pins as you go (see photos). when the outer round of the mane (around the entire circumference of the head) is ready, start filling in the space inside. the fill density will depend on your yarn and whether or not it can be fluffed (combed). if the yarn can be fluffed up and it is quite voluminous, then you do not need to thread the yarn pieces into each stitch of each round, you can make gaps. in any case, you can always add or remove strands. when all the strands are thread, you need to comb the mane with a slicker brush (brus for combing animals) and trim it to desired length. i sewed on the ears after the mane, position them at your discretion and sew.
