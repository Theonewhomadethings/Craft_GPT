snood

we collect a chain from vp with a length of about 60 cm.to try on the length, we close the chain in a ring with a connecting post and try to put this ring on the bear's head in three turns. should be worn loosely. when you have made sure that the desired length of the chain has been reached, you need to connect the chain into a ring with a connecting column, carefully checking that the chain is not twisted anywhere. it is important!
we make 3 ch lifts and crochet in a circle a row with double crochets to the junction. we close the row in a ring using a connecting post with a chain of 3 ch, which we crocheted at the beginning of the row.
we make 3 ch lifts, turn, and crochet a row. in the opposite direction with double crochets behind the back wall of the loop. after crocheting each row, it is better to try on the snood on the bear to make sure that it fits easily.
if desired, you can crochet another row or two of the dc, just as each time at the beginning of the row doing 3 ch lifts and turning around.
we fasten and cut off the end of the yarn, hide the ends between the columns of the snood with a needle. we put the snood on the bear, you can decorate it with a beautiful button.
your bear is ready!
