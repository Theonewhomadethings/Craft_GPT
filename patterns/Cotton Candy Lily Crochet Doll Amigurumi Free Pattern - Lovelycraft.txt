dear friends, hello!
i have a candy-like amigurumi pattern for you guys i hope you like it. first of all, welcome to my blog. our pattern today is an ordinary toy amigurumi doll. i think it will be a good work for beginners. if you wish, you can take a look at our other amigurumi dolls.
when you examine the doll, you will see that it is not very difficult to knit. maybe you have problems with her hair. however, i have prepared a very detailed pattern to make it easier for you. if you choose vivid colors, your doll will look more impressive. it has similar traits with the christmas elf girl i shared before. if you wish, you can take a look other amigurumi christmas doll.
