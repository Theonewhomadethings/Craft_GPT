3. attach arms to the sides of the body. they should be placed on the top mint round of the body.
4. attach legs to the lower part of the body on round 7 (1 round away from mint). feet should be pointed to the inner side. make sure that you attach right leg to the right side and left leg to the left side and colour changes remain on the back side of the toy.
