dear friends, today i will share an easy crochet bunny amigurumi pattern again. if you noticed, this amigurumi doesn't have legs either. however, it can stand perfectly on a flat surface. you can also use this cute bunny amigurumi as a key chain. its size is 10 cm, which i think is a valid reason to use it as a key chain. however, if you are going to use the bunny amigurumi as a keychain, the carrot may cause you some trouble. i think it would be more correct to use it without carrots. now if you're ready, let's get started and make this cute bunny amigurumi.
