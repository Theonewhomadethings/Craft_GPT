13-15. sc in each st around

place eyes between rounds 17 and 18, leaving 16 holes between them. 1st eye is placed before the 2nd increase. count 16 holes after the first eye and place the 2nd eye. if you want the sunken eye look, do not place the backs of the eyes on until row 26.
tip! you may have to adjust the eye placement depending on yarn and hook size you use.

change to color c:
now for the eyes. stuff the head well. cut a long piece of yarn and remove the eyes. place the needle in the hole where the first eye was and thread the needle into a hole next to the eye hole. go back and forth between each eye hole repeating the process from the first eye. pull slightly on the yarn after going through each hole. do this about 3 times on each side until you reach the look you want. follow the pictures for help. there is also a youtube video i have for extra help on this process.
to place the backs of the eyes you will need to remove most of the stuffing to place the washers on the eyes then re stuff it.

look on next page for pictures of the next few rounds
this is what rounds 64-68 will look like.
for the wire. cut a very, very long strand of wire. approximately 5 feet of wire. you may need less or more. i did not have exact estimates. fold the wire in half and twist the wire. fold the wire in half again and twist it. wrap some tape around the edges of the wire to keep it from poking out. insert the wire into the body all the way down to the tip. you will need to navigate the wire into the body around the stuffing. i have worked with a lot of wire projects so you will have to really figure out how to get the wire around the stuffing. it took me a couple tries to get the wire in the body but i also have lots of practice with wire. continue working the body. cut off any excess wire and re tape it if needed. then curl the tail once you are finished. shape it how you want it.

helpful tips:
exact colors and brand of yarn used:
1. yellow: red heart cornflower
2. blue: red heart aqua
3. variegated yarn: loops and threads soft and shiny vibrant sea
4. purple: i love this yarn amethyst
you can use different eye and nose sizes. you might have to adjust the placements if you change the sizes.
you can use different hook sizes and weights of yarn. it will just change the size of your occamy and you might need to adjust eye and nose placement.
how you stuff matters! the type of stuffing you use, how you stuff, all this matters on how your occamy turns out. i prefer polyfil stuffing but you can use other types.
