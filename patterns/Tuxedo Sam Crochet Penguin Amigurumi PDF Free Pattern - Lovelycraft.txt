hi everyone , our character today, tuxedo sam. you can also make different colors according to the yarn you use. our designer has made this character great, and the red details on his tiny white hat look very nice. thanks a lot to him. we hope you enjoy doing the design, have fun too. tuxedo sam is a cute penguin boy who is a japanese anime character, he is a very clumsy little guy who loves to eat and is also very clumsy. he also has a great sense of fashion, our hero wears it in a small hat and a red bow tie.
tuxedo sam is a very cute penguin friend. making crochet penguin amigurumi is quite simple. i tried to share the details with you step by step. however, in such amigurumi patterns, color transitions can be a little difficult. although it is easy to make good amigurumi, especially when velvet rope is used, changing the color can be a bit of a challenge. by the way, the crochet penguin pattern is completely free. but i'm sure you'll get over it. now let's crochet penguin amigurumi together.
