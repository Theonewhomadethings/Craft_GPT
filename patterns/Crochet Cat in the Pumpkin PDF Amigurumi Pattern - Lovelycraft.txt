cut the thread, pull it through the 12 remaining stitches to close the hole and sew it. do not stuff the pumpkin too tightly.
tendril:
ch18, starting from the 2nd ch and crochet 2sc into each stitch. when you reach the end, chain 13 and again crochet 2sc back into each stitch. end with sl st and cut thread long enough to sew it.
*however, you are free to choose how many ch you make here, then the tendril will be shorter or longer.
chenille pumpkin (optional):

rd2: inc x6 (12)
rd3: (1sc, inc) x6 (18)
rd4: (2sc, inc) x6 (24)

rd15: (3sc, dec) x6 (24)
start filling the pumpkin
rd16: (2sc, dec) x6 (18)
rd17: (1sc, dec) x6 (12)
cut the thread, pull it through the 12 remaining stitches to close the hole and sew it. do not stuff the pumpkin too tightly.
important: please note the chenille pumpkin works well for the cotton head, but not for the velvet fine head then you would have to crochet a bigger pumpkin.
tendril:
ch29, starting from the 2nd ch and crochet 2sc into each stitch. when you reach the end, chain 16 and again crochet 2sc back into each stitch. end with sl st and cut thread long enough to sew it.
*however, you are free to choose how many ch you make here, then the tendril will be shorter or longer.
completion of the cot on head:
instead of white, i used a yellow cotton thread for the eye details.
embroider the nose with a pink cotton thread after round 10 with a distance of 3 visible sc.
embroider the eyebrows with a black cotton thread with a distance of 4 visible sc in round 5-6. if you like, you can also embroider little cheeks also in pink under the eyes.
completion of the velvet fine head:
here i used yellow and white cotton threads for the eye details.
embroider the nose with a black cotton thread with a distance of 3 visible sc after round 13. embroider the eyebrows also in black with a distance of 7 visible sc after round 7.
same procedure for both heads: sew the ears on the sides of the head starting on round 3.
completion of salem:
take a long strand of yarn (approx. 60cm) and poke the needle through the center of your pumpkin, starting from the bottom. coming out of the top place the thread around the outside and back to the bottom. poke through the center again and pull the yarn tight. use the "increase lines" as a guide and repeat 5 times. your ball should now be devided into 6 sections and resemble the shape of a pumpkin. make a few knots with the beginning and end part of the yarn. shape the pumpkin a little.
sew the head to the top of the pumpkin.
however, since this is a pin cushion and not a toy, you can also take the end thread from the bottom of the pumpkin, poke through the pumpkin and head from bottom to top, and knot the thread at the top. repeat the step with the end thread of the head, through the pumpkin center down and knot. the head will hold quite well, but is not meant to be pulled too tightly. you can even turn the head this way. (small cheat variant for sewing lazy)
sew the paws on the left and right side of the head on the pumpkin.
sew the tendril to the left side of the pumpkin close to the head to avoid problems when positioning the hat.
sew the hat to the head with a few stitches on the right side. bend it a little so that it gets the typical shape of a witch's hat.
sew the tail to the back center of the pumpkin (the exact position is up to you).
congratulations salem in the pumpkin amigurumi is ready.
