dear friends, are you ready to crochet a new duck amigurumi pattern? today i will share a different duck pattern. for the crochet duck pattern, you first need to find the necessary materials. this is one of the most important conditions. otherwise, you cannot get the same amigurumi. first of all, i have to say that a very different yarn is used. however, this type of yarn made the crochet duck pattern look very realistic and cute. i think different amigurumi patterns can be created with this type of yarn. continuing the duck amigurumi pattern, a very impressive orange color is used on its feet. in addition, you need to use the necessary materials to make the duck's feet look like this.
there is no need to say much about the general appearance of the duck. i must say it's an amazing design. in addition, plastic material was used in the duck's beak. i hope you can do the same amigurumi. now let's crochet the duck amigurumi step by step.
