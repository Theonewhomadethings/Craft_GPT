hello friends. today i will share a different amigurumi bunny pattern. today's crochet bunny has a very realistic look. although it may seem easy, it is an amigurumi pattern that may take some of your time because some parts are difficult to make. it is very difficult to make the patterns, especially on the body. if you are having difficulties in this regard, you can also make these patterns in a flat way. but the most flattering part of this crochet bunny is definitely the body part. the mouth and nose of the amigurumi are made very easily. it's pretty easy to make your eyes.
amigurumi bunny ears look very cute. however, there are a few details behind this cute look. you are using the puff stitch method when making the ears. i explained this in the making of bunny amigurumi. i hope you will like it.

we begin to crochet a pattern, we take linen-colored yarn.
1.when passing from one color to another, the last 2 loops on hook (one is the leading, the other is from the last untied column of the previous color) must be crocheted with a yarn next color. the resulting transact loop on the hook will be a different color.
2. throughout crocheting a row, crochet-free yarn is laid along the edge of the last row and it turns out crocheted inside the canvas. the canvas turns out to be double-sided, i.e looks the same from the front and back. it is only necessary to ensure that the yarn passing through the canvas did not tighten it.
