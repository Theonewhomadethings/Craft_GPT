hello dear friends.
today i am sharing my second amigurumi pattern for halloween. our today's amigurumi pattern is a great zombie pattern. first of all a big thank you to konyshevatoys for this great design. one of the most important figures of halloween is probably zombies. you can use it especially as minimal decorative materials or make a nice surprise for your children.
as for color, they are really vibrant and turquoise. thanks to these primary colors, the amigurumi crochet zombie toy looks quite remarkable. the facial structure is quite similar to the pumpkin i shared before, but it has a unique zombie design. also, her dress is designed quite differently. now let's look at the parts of the pattern step by step.
