assembly
put the eyes between the r14 and r 15 with a separation of 8 holes, on the wrong side of the fabric put the safety (when you are completely sure of the position, once put it is not possible to remove) and pressed with out.
with a piece of felt or black fabric, design the nose of the size you want, forming a triangle with rounded tips, stick a strong glue (i use uhu) between the eyes. put the ears parallel to the eyes, on top of the head. in this part you can embroider the eyebrows and the mouth making a knot on the wrong side of the head fabric. sew the body to the head.
in the arms and legs, the hole must first be closed by matching the stitch of each edge and cook them one by one. sew the legs to the sides on the inside of the body and the arms to the sides in the upper part of the body in a diagond shape.
roll dark brown wool across the widest part of the palm, cut at the upper part of the hand the strands, these should be placed around the face and the whole head taking the mane, so you will need many of these strands. take one yarn and fold it in half, insert the crochet into a stitch on the head (begins in front of the ears and follow that line around the face), take the strand that you doubled and with the crochet. pull it through the stitch, the loop left when folding the strand, expand it and pass the ends of the strand through it, in this way a knot will be formed. keep putting strands around face and head. also put strands on the tip of the tail, cut a little, findly sew the tail to the back of the body. to give expression to his face, embroider with black thread his eyebrows and mouth, trying to tie a knot in the back of his head to the body to make it firm, you can also embroider it before sewing the head to the body by making the knot on the wrong side of the head tissue.
congratulations, you have completed the juan amigurumi lion pattern.
