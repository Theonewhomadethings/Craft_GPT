hi everyone,
i would like to thank the beaba organization, which fights for children, youth and their families. i shared it with you because i believe that the amigurumi pattern is its symbol. you can knit this amigurumi bear pattern for your children and loved ones. you can crochet this amigurumi beaba pattern step by step. you can sell the beaba amigurumi pattern you made and help charities.
the beaba amigurumi pattern is very easy to do. you can do it with yarns that you don't use at home. the thickness of the threads that you need to pay attention to should be the same. all parts of the amigurumi crochet pattern are knitted separately and sewn to the body part. you can make the red heart pattern on the body of the amigurumi bear pattern using red fabric. don't forget to add the beaba amigurumi pattern to your favorites list.
