tip! you may have to adjust the eye placement depending on yarn and hook size you use.
place your eyes between rounds 16 and 17. place the 1st eye before the 1st increase. where you placed your first stitch marker, one hole before that stitch marker. count 11 holes after that eye and place the 2nd after the last increase. stuff the head well. cut a long piece of yarn and remove the eyes. place the needle in the hole where the first eye was and thread the needle into a hole next to the eye hole. go back and forth between each eye hole repeating the process from the first eye. pull slightly on the yarn after going through each hole. do this about 3 times on each side until you reach the look you want. follow the pictures for help. there is also a youtube video i have for extra help on this process. place the nose in between the eyes. place the backs of the eyes. you may need to remove some of the stuffing the place the backs of the eyes on.

assembly
head and body:
1. thread your needle with a long strand of white yarn. insert the needle into a spot on the head near the eye. bring the needle to a lower corner of the eye. wrap the needle around the eye and insert the needle into a hole on a top corner of the eye. pull slightly. not too tightly or you will lose the yarn for the eye highlight.
2. optional: take a wire pet brush and brush the yarn lightly on the grinch. i did not brush too much, just enough to give him a slight brushed out look. brush the arms, legs and body and head.
3. thread your needle with a long strand of black embroidery thread. insert the needle approximately between rounds 20 and 21. embroider a smile line on both of the sides of the face. embroider a smile line going across the face. embroider a line in the middle of the face. take your needle and embroider some eyebrows.
hair:
1. cut approximately 12 strands of green yarn approximately 8 inches in length.
2. insert the hook into the top of the head, double strand your yarn pieces. make a knot with the yarn to attach the hair. take your wire brush and brush out the yarn.
trim the yarn. twist the yarn into 4 pieces.
arms:
1. pin the arms at an angle, facing forward. you will be placing the approximately between rounds 32 and 36.
2. sew the arms onto the body.
legs:
1. turn the body upside down and pin the legs approximately between rounds 5 and 6.
2. sew the legs onto the body.
heart:
1. cut a heart out of red felt. you can make it smaller than mine or bigger.
2. you can sew or hot glue the heart onto the body. you can also use fabric glue.
helpful tips:
exact colors and brand of yarn used:
1. green: i love this yarn limelight
you can use different eye and nose sizes. you might have to adjust the placements if you change the sizes.
you can use different hook sizes and weights of yarn. it will just change the size of your grinch and you might need to adjust eye and nose placement.
how you stuff matters! the type of stuffing you use, how you stuff, all this matters on how your grinch turns out. i prefer polyfil stuffing but you can use other types.
