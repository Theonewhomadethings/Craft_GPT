now for the eyes. stuff the head well. cut a long piece of yarn and remove the eyes. place the needle in the holes where the eyes were. now thread the needle and in a hole next to the eye hole, go back and forth between the two eye holes. pull slightly on the yarn after going through each hole. do this about 3 times on each side until you reach the look you want. to place the backs of the eyes you will need to remove most of the stuffing, then re stuff it after. follow the pictures for help.

assembly
head and body:
1. pin the head onto the body for extra support. you may need to add more stuffing as you sew.
2. sew the head onto the body.
arms:
1. pin the arm in a forward facing angle. there are no particular rows i place them on as it depends on how you stuff, shape, etc. its just better to judge how you want them.
2. sew the arm onto the body.
legs:
1. turn the body upside down with the nose facing away from you.
2. pin the legs onto the bottom of the body.
there are no special rows for this, just depends on the look you would like. i don't place mine in between any special rows. i just judge based on how the individual doll looks.
3. sew the legs onto the body.
ears:
1. pin the ears onto the top of the head. i do not have certain rows i place these on. since these are handmade, i never am able to stuff the head the same exact way twice. i just place the ears where they look best on the head above the eyes judged on each individual doll.
2. sew the ears onto the head.
embellishments:
1. embroider some eyebrows with black thread.
2. add some blush to the cheeks if wanted.
