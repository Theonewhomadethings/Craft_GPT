let's start with the head as the first step to make the crochet plush eeyore amigurumi pattern, guys.
face
for the seam that goes down eeyore's face, using color f, start from under the
head where color b ends and secure the thread. now make a long stitch all the way
up to round 15 of the head, make sure the thread is pulled tight without denting
the face and secure in place. make four small stitches across the thread between
row 7-8, 8-9, 11-12 and 12-13.
face (continued)
the nostrils are sewn on across row 7, from bottom to top using color f.
the start of the stitch will be 2 stitches away from the face seam and the
end will be 3 stitches away to get an angle.
the mouth is made with one long stitch, using colour f. make a stitch between
row 7 and 8,7 stitches down from the middle seam an each side. the middle of the
mouth will sit between row 5 and 6, use pins to keep in place before stitching in
place. if you'd like to create some dimples you can pull a thread (colour b) throught the
muzzle connecting the two start points and pull tightliy to create the dimples.
the eyes are sewn on across round 12 and 13,2 stiches away from the seam on each side.
using colour e, make 3 stitches across the 2 rows. using colour f, you'll now only be
stitching across row 13. go up between the white stitches and keep going over in the same
stitches for about 5 rounds, or untill the white thread has been covered in the middle across
row 13.
the eyelids are done by using color a and making a semi loose stitch across where the black
part of the eye end, slightly overlapping.
the eyebrows are sewn on across row 14, from top to bottom, using colour f.
starting 1 stitch away from the middle seam, make a diagonal stitch so that
the end of the stitch is 2 stitches away from the seam.
then we complete the face part of the eeyore amigurumi toy and let's start crocheting those cute ears.
ears (make 2)
part1:
1. using colour a chain 11, turn
2. sc in second st from the hook and across all 10 stitches
3. sc across the 10 sts on the other side of the chain
4. sc across both sides again, adding 1 extra st on each end
fasten off, leaving a long tail for attaching the ears to the head.
part2:
1. using colour d chain 9, turn
2. sc in second st from the hook and across all 8 stitches
3. sc across the 8 sts on the other side of the chain
fasten off, leaving a long tail for sewing the two parts together.
sew part 2 to the middle of part1.
using colour a, make a couple of stitches on the end of each ear across 2
stithes to make it look pointed.
attach the ears between row 14 and 15 with 4 sts in between.
we've completed the ears of the eeyore amigurumi, let's move on to crocheting the body, which is another step.
body
1. using colour a, work 6 sc in magic ring (6)
2. inc in each st (12)
3. *1 sc, 1 inc** repeat* to**6 times (18)
4. *2 sc, 1 inc** repeat* to**6 times (24)
5. *3 sc, 1 inc** repeat* to**6 times (30)
6. *4 sc, 1 inc** repeat* to**6 times (36)
7-10. sc in each st
11. *4 sc, 1 inv.dec** repeat* to**6 times (30)
12. sc in each st
13. *3 sc, 1 inv.dec** repeat* to**6 times (24)
14-15. sc in each st
16. *2 sc, 1 inv.dec** repeat* to**6 times (18)
17. sc in each st
18. *1 sc, 1 inv.dec** repeat* to**6 times (12)
19-20. sc in each st
fasten off leaving a long tail for sewing the last stitches together.
stuff the body firmly before closing up the body with a flat seam across
your stitches. attach to round 12 of the head. you should be able to tilt
eeyore's head up and down so he can lie flat as well as sit.
after crocheting the body of the eeyore amigurumi pattern, we move on to the construction of the legs.
legs (make 2)
1. using colour c, work 6 sc in magic ring (6)
2. inc in each st (12)
3. *2 sc, 1 inc** repeat* to**4 times (16)
4. sc in each st
5-6. change to colour a, sc in each st
7. *2 sc, 1 inv.dec** repeat* to**4 times (12)
8. *4 sc, 1 inv.dec** repeat* to**2 times (10)
9-13. sc in each st
fasten off leaving a long tail sewing the last stitches together.
stuff the larger bottom part of the foot firmly and the upper part lightly.
as with the body, the legs are closed up with a straight seam across the top.
attach the legs between row 6 to 10 of the body.
after crocheting the back legs, let's start the process to make the arms.
arms (make 2)
1. using colour c, work 6 sc in magic ring (6)
2. inc in each st (12)
3. sc in each st
4-5. change to colour a, sc in each st
6. *1 sc, 1 inv.dec** repeat* to**4 times (8)
7-13. sc in each st
fasten off leaving a long tail for sewing the last stitches together.
stuff the larger bottom part of the arm firmly and the upper part lightly.
close up the arm with a straight seam across the top.
attach the arms between row 16 to 18 of the body.
we crocheted the cute donkey's arms, now it's that cute bowtie tail.
tail
1. using colour a, chain 9, turn
2. sc in the second st from the hook and across all 8 sts
fasten off leaving a long tail for attaching the tail to body.
using colour f, cut 10 lengths of 5cm, fold each length in half.
using your hook, pull the folded end throght the bottom of the tail and
put the non-folded part throught the hoop. continue across the bottom of the tail.
use a needle to seperate the strands of the yarn to make it look a bit bushier, trim
the strands to get a straight end.
attach the tail to row 8 of the body.
bow
1. using colour d, chain 7, turn
2. sc in the second st from the hook and across all 6 st
3. sc across the 6 stitches on the other side
fasten off leaving a long tail for the middle part, make sure it's long enough to also
attach the bow to the tail.
using the long tail, do 3 loops around the middle of the chain to create a bow like shape.
secure in place and use the same tail to attach the bow just above where you added the black yarn.
we have completed the tail, now we are making a cute bow tie on the tail.
hair
using colour f, cut 20-25 lengths of 5cm.
(keep adding untill you're happy with the coverage)
using the same mathod as with the tail attach the strands to top of
eeyore's head, starting in the row above the eyebrows and down the back of
his head in a straight line.
once you're done trim the hair so that it's shorter down the back of the head
and longer on top. the top will need trimming as well. seperate the strands as you
did with the tail.
finally, we make the cute crochet eeyore donkey's hair and we will have completed the amigurumi pattern.
