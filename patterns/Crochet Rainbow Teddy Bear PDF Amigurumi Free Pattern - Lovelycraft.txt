changing the yarn colour:
while doing a single crochet:
start the single crochet stitch as normal (yarn over and pull through), leaving two loops on your hook. wrap the new colour yarn around the hook and pull the new colour through the two loops on your hook, completing the single crochet stitch and colour change. continue as normal in the new colour. please refer to pictures below.
if you need to make a stitch in new colour, do these steps on the previous stitch.
