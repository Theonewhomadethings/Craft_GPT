hello dear friends. today we will crochet a brand new and very cute amigurumi pattern with you. our crochet pattern for today is gingerbread. a truly magnificent doll is designed. i have shared gingerbread amigurumi patterns before. if you wish, you can examine the previous amigurumi patterns. after preparing the necessary materials for the pattern, you can start working with crochet. when you examine the ready version of the amigurumi doll, you will see that it is crocheted in two different ways. the first is made with an ordinary yarn and the other is made with velvet yarn.
actually, velvet yarn has different advantages. you can see this on gingerbread amigurumi. amigurumis made using velvet rope are slightly larger and have a structure that hides mistakes. when you do it with the same number of stitches, you will see that it is noticeably larger. now let's crochet the gingerbread amigurumi step by step.

assembly
1. sew on the arms 2 rounds lower the head.

3. embroider a smile with a fine white thread on 4th round, 4-5 sc wide.
4. buttons: cut a thread about 30 cm long, make a loop, pass one of the ends of the thread in this loop 5-6 times, then carefully pull both ends making a little ball. make 3 buttons like that, then sew them on between 13th and 14th rounds, 16th and 17th rounds, and between 19th and 20th rounds.
5. sew the glaze on top of the head, then embroider the multi-colored sprinkles with small stitches, sew the berry on top.
