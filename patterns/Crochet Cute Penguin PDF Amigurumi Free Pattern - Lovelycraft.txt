we fasten the yarn and hide it. we sew the paws a little at an angle or as you like.
we sew the legs along the loop, so that the fingers are directed to the sides.
the tail is sewn on the back in the center at the level of the legs. so that he does not touch the table if planted.
embroider eyes and beak with a rhombus.
