hello dear friends. today we are adding a new one to the bunny amigurumi patterns. today's crochet bunny pattern is pretty cute. i know it's a little big bunny amigurumi. therefore, it will be both tiring and long to work with crochet. that's why it's very important to be patient. one of the most important details here is the use of velvet rope and the difference in the technique used.
you have to work a little more while making the bunny amigurumi face. the important detail here is that the lower part of the bunny's jaw is narrowed. this creates a different facial expression. then you can see that the other parts are pretty simple. now let's crochet bunny amigurumi step by step.
