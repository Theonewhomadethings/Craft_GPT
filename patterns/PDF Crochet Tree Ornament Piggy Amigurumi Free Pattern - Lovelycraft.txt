tightening of the eyes and embroidery eyebrows and nose is more convenient to do before the complete closure of the loops. we make tightening in the 8th row. (in the area of the 13th sc and the 17th sc, or we focus on the legs so that it is symmetrical) we sew eyes on the place of the ties. we embroider nostrils and eyebrows. we knit a tail. make sl st in sc opposite the loop on the hook. 9ch, starting from the second loop from the hook, make 3sc in each ch. cut the thread, fasten.
let's crochet the ears of the amigurumi pig pattern
ears
we knit the left ear.
we hold the piglet facing us. in the 14th row, in the region of 18-19 sc (or obliquely from the eye), we fix the thread, 2ch, retreat 2 sc (16-17sc), fix the knitting one row below, in the 13th row. it turned out to be a small arch. we make 2ch, knit 9 dc into this arch, 2 ch, slst at the beginning of knitting, fasten, and cut the thread. hide the threads. the right ear is made in the same way, just starting to work by securing the thread in the 13th row, 2 ch, retreat 2sc, and fix the knitting one row higher, in the 14th row. 2ch, 9dc in the arch, 2 ch, fasten the thread, cut.
nose decoration: attach the thread to the remaining half-loops of the 5th row and knit one row with a crustacean step. we hold the pig with its nose towards us.
congratulations, you have completed the christmas tree ornament amigurumi pig pattern.
