hello to everyone,
the magic mouse is visiting your house to surprise you. he will amuse you and surprise you with his surprises. we love magic shows.
the magician mouse stands out with his pointed magician hat. the costume selection was very elegant. he has stars on his hat. the detail of the cloak, which is suitable for the mouse's costume, is perfectly thought out. the foot part is knitted brown, this process is also applied on the body part of the amigurumi. the most beautiful detail that completes the costume is the magic stick in the hand of the magician mouse, and when you finish the toy, don't forget to add a small piece of branch.

place eyes between rounds 12 and 13, leaving 9 holes between them. 1st eye is placed after the 2nd increase. count 9 holes after the first eye and place the 2nd eye. if you want the sunken eye look, do not place the backs of the eyes on until row 26. tip! you may have to adjust the eye placement depending on yarn and hook size you use.

now for the eyes. stuff the head well. cut a long piece of yarn and remove the eyes. place the needle in the hole where the first eye was and thread the needle into a hole next to the eye hole. go back and forth between each eye hole repeating the process from the first eye. pull slightly on the yarn after going through each hole. do this about 3 times on each side until you reach the look you want. follow the pictures for help. there is also a youtube video i have for extra help on this process.
to place the backs of the eyes you will need to remove most of the stuffing to place the washers on the eyes then re stuff it.

legs:
1. place the legs on the side of the body approximately between rounds 8 and 12.
2. sew the legs onto the body at the top of the legs. if you want the legs to stay on the side of the body well, bring the needle to a stitch on the thigh of the leg and sew one stitch down to the side of the body. this will keep the legs sturdier.
arms:
1. pin the arms onto the side of the body at an angle approximately between rounds 21 and 24.

ears:
1. pin the ears onto the top of the head approximately between rounds 20 and 21.

2. sew the tail onto the body.
embellishments:
1. cut a medium length strand of white embroidery thread or white yarn. thread your needle and insert the needle into a stitch on the side of the head. bring the needle above the eye approximately 3 rounds above the eye. insert the needle one round down and 2 stitches over. repeat this about 3 times. repeat for the 2nd eyebrow.
2. thread your needle with a long strand of white yarn and insert the needle into a stitch on the side of the head. bring the needle to a hole on the corner of the eye. bring the needle to a stitch at the top of the eye and insert the needle. you may need to tighten the strand a little to make it sit underneath the eye. repeat for the 2nd eye.
3. take a very long strand of pink yarn, thread your needle with it. insert the needle into the magic ring and bring the needle to a stitch on top of the nose between rounds 2 and 3. bring the needle back down to the magic ring to start embroidering the nose. pull the yarn to tighten it up and repeat about 12 more times. weave in the yarn tails.
4. add some blush to the cheeks and inside the ears with actual blush.
hat and cape:
1. take your star buttons and either sew them onto the hat or hot glue them onto the hat. i chose to sew them onto the hat, leave room for your hat band.
2. sew your hat band onto the hat.
3. pin the hat onto the top of the head between the ears.
4. sew the hat onto the head. (i chose not to stuff the hat)
5. tie the cape around the neck.
helpful tips:
exact colors and brand of yarn used:
1. gray: i love this yarn light grey
2. blue: i love this yarn dark blue
3. red: red heart holly berry
4. brown: red heart cafe latte
5. gold: caron simply gold
you can use different eye and nose sizes. you might have to adjust the placements if you change the sizes. you can use different hook sizes and weights of yarn. it will just change the size of your mouse and you might need to adjust eye and nose placement. how you stuff matters! the type of stuffing you use, how you stuff, all this matters on how your mouse turns out. i prefer polyfil stuffing but you can use other types.
