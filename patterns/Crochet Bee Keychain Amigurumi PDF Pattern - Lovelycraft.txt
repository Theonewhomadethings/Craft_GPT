hello dear friends. today we will make the crochet keychain amigurumi pattern together. even though the pattern is designed as a bee figure, it does not look exactly like a bee. we have nothing to do about it. since it is already designed as a crochet keychain, it makes much more sense to have this size and shape. i think the colors of the bee are designed very successfully. usually monochrome bees are made. but the use of different colors in this crochet amigurumi pattern looks more impressive.
i am trying to share insect amigurumi patterns as well as animal amigurumi. i will try to share the doll keychain amigurumi patterns as i find them. now let's crochet the bee keychain amigurumi step by step.
