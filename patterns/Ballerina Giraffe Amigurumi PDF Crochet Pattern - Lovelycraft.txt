assembly
head and body:

tip! if you pin the head onto the neck, your head will stay in place and make it easier to sew it on.
arms:
1. pin the arms into place.
2. sew the arms onto the body.
tip! closing the seam by crocheting over the opening will make sewing it to the body easier. also the arms and ears will lay nicely flat, instead of sticking out.
legs and shoes:
1. sew shoe onto the foot and make the ballerina strap on the foot by crossing over each. other the extra yarn tail.
2. sew the legs onto the body.
ears and horns:
1. pin the ears onto the head and sew them in place.

bow:
1. pinch the crocheted piece together to form a bow
2. then sew the long tail back and forth to hold the pinch together
