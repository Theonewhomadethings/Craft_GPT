hello dear friends. today i'm going to share a pretty small yet gorgeous crochet tiger pattern. the tiger amigurumi, which you can use as a keychain, has a very cute design. tiger amigurumi is formed by making and combining parts separately. it seems like an event to be made, as the amigurumi has a rather small size. however, because there are too many color transitions, it will be a bit of a work. now let's crochet the tiger amigurumi step by step.
