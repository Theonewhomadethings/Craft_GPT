dear friends,
today i will share a cute and tiny crochet teddy bear amigurumi pattern. when you crochet the amigurumi bear, it will have a size of 13 cm. i can say that it is an easy amigurumi pattern because it is a little small. there are not many details and it usually has oval lines. although the arms and head of the crocheted teddy bear are made as a separate piece, the legs are made together with the body. i recommend that you pay attention to these parts.
this kind of teddy bear amigurumis can also be used as a key chain, although not very often. however, i think the size of this amigurumi is a little big for a key chain. you can browse other animal amigurumi and doll amigurumi patterns in our keychain amigurumi category. now let's crochet the teddy bear amigurumi step by step.

attention! due to the difference in the crocheting method, yarn, yarn tension, the parts to be crocheted may shift. to place them nicely, add or subtract sc (offset loops) as needed.
cut the yarn, hide the tip.
it remains to sew the head to the body and decorate the bear with a bow.
bow:

next, along the entire perimeter of the bow, we crochet slst.
we tighten the ring tightly, cut the yarn, leave a long tip, wind a little yarn in the center of the bow. we fix the yarn.
