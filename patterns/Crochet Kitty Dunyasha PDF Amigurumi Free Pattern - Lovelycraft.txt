hello my dears. today i am going to share an amazing kitty pattern. this amigurumi pattern is free. as you can see it is very easy to make. therefore, it will be a very good choice for you, my dear friends who are just starting out. especially cat amigurumi patterns can be quite difficult. if we talk about the construction of the cat, it is formed by combining different parts. the mouth and nose parts are made with the help of a small rope. also, a pink ribbon was chosen. it's a very nice design. now if you're ready, let's get start.
