stuff the head firmly the fiberfill (start stuffing after rd18 and before you start with the body, the head must be stuffed firmly).
shape the head whilest stuffing. i always stuff a bit more fiberfill in the cheeks, the head is then a bit wider at the bottom. now its time to put some tension to the eyes, so the view is cuter.
don't cut the yarn off. we are carrying on with crocheting the body. note that there will be a colour change.

assembly head
for the eyerim i used white cotton yarn and with a coloured yarn (i used purple) i embroidered a small accent.
the eyelid is made with black cotton yarn and the lashes with thin black thread.
i made the nose with pink cotton yarn in rd13 over a length of 3sc. with thin black embroidery thread you can put some details to the nose.
the eyebrows are embroidered the thin black thread slightly aslant in rd8. the distance between them should be 6sc.
if you like, you can embroider cheeks with pink thread under the eyes (i would make them 2sc wide).
sew the ears on the left and right side of the head between round 3/4.
