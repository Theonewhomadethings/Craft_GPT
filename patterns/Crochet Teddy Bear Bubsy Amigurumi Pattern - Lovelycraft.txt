we knit the head part of our free amigurumi bear pattern first and then move on to the body part.
body (use brown color)
get support from the visuals when sewing the body with the head. we do the leg-play parts of the body in 12-13 rows. those parts will appear as protrusions in the body. align the front of the head with the front of the body after the body knitting is finished. you can do the sewing process after rehearsing with the help of marker pins. there will be space between body and head planting. when sewing fill these areas with fiber.

after completing the body part with crochet, we fill the body part with polyester fiber and assemble the head. then we'll move on to making the legs.
legs (with cream color/ brown yarn and make 2)
please look through the pictures while sewing the legs to the body. fasten off the first leg using your tapestry needle and break the yarn. fasten off the second leg using your tapestry needle but do not break the yarn. using your needle pull the yarn trough a stitch from outer side of the body to the inner side of the body (from the right bottom of the body) pull the needle trough back the same stitch and pull it out from the opposite side of the body through the second leg to fix the legs. we will have movable legs by this way.
please look through the schematic while sewing the pieces on the body.
