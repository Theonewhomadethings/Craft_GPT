hello dear friends.
today i am going to share a cute doll girl amigurumi pattern. however, the crochet cat pattern that i will share today can be a bit challenging. for easy amigurumi cat patterns, you can check out other amigurumi cat patterns. cat amigurumis are actually being designed in a more plush way lately. velvet rope is often preferred when making. such amigurumi patterns are not preferred much anymore. the biggest reason for this is that it is difficult to make and you have to spend a lot of time while making it because it is quite detailed.
when you see the amigurumi cat, you can already see the excess of details. the cat's cheeks and bandana look great. especially the skirt is really well designed. also, the red shoes look very impressive. crochet cat's ears are also quite realistic. i think it is a very right choice to make the ears pointy as in the image. now let's crochet the cat amigurumi step by step.
