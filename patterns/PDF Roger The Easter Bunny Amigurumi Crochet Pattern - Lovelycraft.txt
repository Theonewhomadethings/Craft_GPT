hello to everyone,
the most beautiful crochet for easter day will be this bunny toy. you can read how to crochet the amigurumi pattern in detail in the description. when the amigurumi free pattern is completed, you can give it to your loved ones as a gift.
roger the easter rabbit amigurumi toy is very easy to make. i really liked the baby bunny pattern inside the egg mold. amigurumi rabbit's ears are large. the colors of the ears are crocheted using blue yarn. the inside of the ears of the amigurumi toy is crocheted with yellow yarn. the head and body of the free pattern are crocheted with blue yarn. amigurumi bunny has a chocolate colored egg in his hands. the eyes and mouth are easy to crochet. the leg of the rabbit is slightly different from other toys. to make this part, we make eggshells. we sew the leg and tail on this eggshell. you will love it when the amigurumi free pattern is complete.
