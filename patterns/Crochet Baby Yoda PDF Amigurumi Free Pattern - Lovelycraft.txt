dec decrease

i used 8ply yarn with 4mm hook for the body & brown coat. 12ply with 4mm hook for the beige part. 15mm plastic safety eyes but size up or down according to your yarn and hook size.
this pattern is worked in continuous rounds except for the coat, which is worked in rows. there's no need to slip stitch to join or ch1 at the end of each round. coat sleeves worked in continuous rounds.
head (use green)
1. work 8 sc in a magic circle (8)
2. inc in each sc x 8 (16)
3. (inc, sc) x 8 (24)
4. (inc, sc in next 2 sc) x 8 (32)
5. (inc, sc in next 3 sc) x 8 (40)
6. (inc, sc in next 4 sc) x 8 (48)
7. sc in each stitch for rounds 7-13 (48)
14. (dec, sc in next 4) x 8 (40)
15. (dec, sc in next 3) x 8 (32)
16. (dec, sc in next 2) x 8 (24)
17. (dec, sc) x 8 (16)
and fasten off. leave a long tail to stitch onto the body
do not stitch shut as we will stitch the head onto the body later.
*insert safety eyes between rows 11 & 12, 9 sc apart.
after we will crochet to baby yoda amigurumi ears.
ears (make 2 in green)
1. work 4 sc in a magic circle (4)
2. (inc, sc) x 2 (6)
3. (inc, sc) x 3 (9)
4. sc all around (9)
5. (inc, sc) x 4, inc (14)
6. sc all around for rows 6 8 (14)
9. sc, hdc, hdc, dc, dc, tc, tc, tc, tc, dc, dc, hdc, hdc, sc (14)
10. sc all around (14)
11. sc all around (14)
12. (dec, sc) x 4, sc, sc (10)
13. sc all around (10) and leave a long tail to stitch onto the head
i would suggest stuffing the head and stitching it on the body before you stitch on the ears. a fully stuffed head is easier to manage than a floppy one.
stitch the top of the ears between rows 8 & 9 and the bottom of his ears between rows 13 & 14 with the pointy parts facing downwards.
if you've used 15mm eyes, the ears are located 6 stitches away from the edge of the eye. adjust accordingly to the size of the eyes you've used.
complated to the ears of baby yoda amigurumi doll. we will crochet to feet of baby yoda.
feet (make 2 in green)
1. work 6 sc in a magic circle (6)
