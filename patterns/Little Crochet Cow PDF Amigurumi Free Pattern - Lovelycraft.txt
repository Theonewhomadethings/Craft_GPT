tail (make 1):
either braid three pieces of white yarn into a tail to make a 3-4 cm long tail or make a basic crochet cord using this technique:
make a slip knot on the needle, leaving a long tail. wrap working yarn around index finger and yarn tail around thumb, so both sides of the yarn make kind of a v-shape. hold on to the bottom of the slipknot with your right hand to make sure it stays straight. loop the yarn tail on your thumb around the needle from front to back so that you have two loops on your hook. yarn over with the working yarn from your index finger and pull the working yarn through both loops on the hook, repeat until desired length.
fasten off and fray the yarn ends on the tail.
assembly
sew legs onto bottom of body slightly pointing outwards.
use pins to fix legato body and try out the best placement before sewing.
sew snout to head. sew one spot to side of the head and one to the top of the body. sew ears to head.
embroider eyes on head (or use oval safety eyes) and nose holes on snout. attach tail to body
