so, what parts does this elf girl have? friends, you can find all the pieces you see in the picture in the pattern. her dress, which is prepared adjacent to her body, has a really elegant design. also, the red speckles on her cheeks look very cute. i will not say without mentioning his hat. even though the hat is an ordinary christmas hat, it is quite difficult to design this small. i hope you will like it. let's examine the details of the pattern now.
