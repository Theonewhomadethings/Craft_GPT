assembly
begin with benny's face:
put safety eyes between r 8-9, 4 stitches appart.
embroider the nose with <> shape
row 9 of the head is where we are going to sew the cheeks, that's why it's better to stuff them with fiber to make them chubby.
before sewing the tail, recommend passing the thread through the stitches to close the hole and make it easier to sew.
embroider the forehead with white thread as in the picture
