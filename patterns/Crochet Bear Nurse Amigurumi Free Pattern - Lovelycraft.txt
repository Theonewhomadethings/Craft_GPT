materials
3.5mm hook
2.5mm hook
2.0mm hook
worsted weight cotton yarn
2- 10mm safety eyes
1- 8mm safety nose
head and body
begin with brown yarn. use a 3.5mm hook.
do not stuff your head or put safety eyes in until you are instructed to do so. this will guarantee proper alignment of the face with the v-neck in the shirt.
rnd 1: ch 2, 6sc in 2nd ch from the hook (6)
rnd 2: (inc)*6 (12)
rnd 3: (sc,inc)*6 (18)
rnd 4: (2sc,inc)*6 (24)
rnd 5: (3sc,inc)*6 (30)
rnd 6: (4sc,inc)*6 (36)
rnd 7-13: (7 rows): 36sc (36)
rnd 14: (4sc,dec)*6 (30)
rnd 15: (3sc,dec)*6 (24)
rnd 16: (2sc,dec)*6 (18)
rnd 17: (sc,dec)*6 (12)
the head is completed. continue to make the attached body. continue to stuff as you go.for rows 18-29, red indicates color change to white yarn. black text means complete theese parts with turquoise for the remainder of this head and body segment. change to turquoise yarn to begin row 18.
rnd 18: flo (inc)*3, (inc)*4, (inc)*5 (24)
at this point, you will insert eyes. as you choose your placement, keep in mind the v-neck should line up with the face. place the eyes between rows 10 and 11, 6 or 7 stitches apart (or about 5 visible stitches, not covered by the eyes). the nose will be between rows 11 and 12, spaced evenly between the eyes. inserting the backs of the eyes will take some manipulation since you have crocheted quite a bit of fabric and have decreased to only 12sc at one point. i scrunched the head and pushed the part of the fabric where inserted each eye close to the opening. this allows me to more clear see when place the back onto the safety eye. then repeat this for the nose and the other eye. stuff the head and continue to stuff as you go. these pictures have black instead of turquoise yarn. that is because these pictures were taken from another pattern, but the technique is identical.
rnd 19: (3sc,inc)*2, 3sc,inc, (3sc,inc)*3 (30)
rnd 20: 12sc, 2sc, 16sc (30)
rnd 21-23: (3 rows): 30sc (30)
rnd 24: flo 30 sl st (complete one slip stitch on each single crochet stitch from row 24 to create the bottom rim of the shirt). (30)
hint: as you're crocheting along the front loops, make sure you can identify the back loops from row 24, as you will be crocheting along them next.

assembly of ears and limbs
fold ears slightly so that they are rounded and decide where you would like them placed upon head. i put my yarn tail in my tapestry needle and inserted it between rows 6 and 7, went beneath the stitches and pulled the tapestry needle back up between rows 10 and 11. i thread the yarn through the other end of my ear, pull to tighten a little and then sew the bottom of the ear alongside the head. sew arms near rows 18-20 at the sides of the body, very slightly towards the front side.
sew legs facing forward near rows 25-28. (i placed the legs about 5 stitches apart, but you can make them closer if you prefer).
mask
use light blue yarn and a 2.5mm hook.
rnd 1: ch 9, starting from the 2nd ch from the hook, complete 8sc (8)
rnd 2-4: (3rows): ch1, turn, 8sc (8)
rnd 5: ch 1, turn, 3 slst, 2sc, inc, 3 slst (10)
rnd 6: ch 1, turn, 3 slst, 4sc, 3 slst (10)
step 1: ch 32
step 2: insert your hook into the stitch on the furthest end of the other side on row 4. complete a slst here.
step 3: turn your work to complete 6 slst evenly spaced along the edge of the mask.
step 4: ch 20
step 5: insert your hook in the bottom corner gap on the other side of the mask. (this will be the bottom right corner of the maske in the picture beneath step 3).
step 6: turn your work to complete 6 slst along the edge of the mask.
fasten off and weave in ends. place on the bear's face. because the body is smaller than the head, it will be easier to pull the mask on by sliding the bottom of the bear through it (instead of pulling the mask over the head).
pocket
use turquoise yarn and a 2.5mm hook.
rnd 1: ch 3, starting from the 2nd ch from the hook complete 2sc (2)
rnd 2: ch 1, turn, 2sc (2)
fasten off and sew the pocket onto the skirt with all edges attached to the bear except the top one (just like a pocket). i sewed mine on the left side of the bear near rows 20-21.
heart
use the weight 2 red yarn and a 2.0mm hook.
rnd 1: ch2, in 2nd ch from the hook, complete: 2sc,dc,tr,ch3, slst,ch3,tr,dc,2sc,slst to the first sc you made.
sew the heart near rows 20-22 on to the top left side of your bear.
id badge
use weight 2 white yarn and a 2.5mm hook.
rnd 1: ch5, starting from the 2nd ch from the hook complete 4 sc (4)
rnd 2: ch1, turn, 4sc (4)
next, ch 1, and create a border of single crochets evenly spaced around the rectangle. i complete 2sc in each corner. slst to the first single crochet you made, and f.o.
use embroidery thread to add any details you wish to the badge. i did a little box (where the picture of the nurse bear would be) and some squiggly lines surrounding the box to resemble words that might be on the id badge. tie the ends of the embroidery thread on the back of the badge and cut the ends shorter as necessary.
lanyard
use a 2.5mm hook. with your light blue yarn insert your hook into one of the top coerners of the id badge and create a slip stitch. complete 28 ch (or enough chains to reach your desired length). next, wrap the chain around your bear's neck and connect the chain to the other top corner of your id badge with a slip stitch. (i complete it this way so don't have to squeeze the chain around the bear's body). before making the final slst, make sure your chain isn't twisted.
next, you have two options. 1. you can sew the d badge into plaece in front of the bear. this is what did. 2. if you wish to have the d badge dangle, you could create another white panel (repeating rows 1,2,and completing the border) and sew the two panels together in order to hide the embroidery floss ends at the back of the front part of the badge.
