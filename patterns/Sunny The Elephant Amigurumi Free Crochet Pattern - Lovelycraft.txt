tip! you may have to adjust the eye placement depending on yarn and hook size you use.
stuff the head well. cut a long piece of yarn and remove the eyes. place the needle in the hole where the first eye was and thread the needle into a hole next to the eye hole. go back and forth between each eye hole repeating the process from the first eye. pull slightly on the yarn after going through each hole. do this about 3 times on each side until you reach the look you want. follow the pictures for help. there is also a youtube video i have for extra help on this process. place behind the eyes. you may need to remove some of the filling behind the eyes. follow the pictures below for help.

helpful tips:
exact colors and brand of yarn used:
1. gray: i love this yarn gray mist
2. yellow: red heart daffodil
3. green: red heart spring green

you can use different eye and nose sizes. you might have to adjust the placements if you change the sizes. you can use different hook sizes and weights of yarn. it will just change the size of your elephant and you might need to adjust eye placement. how you stuff matters! the type of stuffing you use, how you stuff, all this matters on how your elephant turns out. i prefer polyfil stuffing but you can use other types.
