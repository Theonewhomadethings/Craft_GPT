hello to everyone,
friends, today i will share two different patterns. the first is the pattern of the teddy bear and the other part is the pattern of crochet teddy bear amigurumi outfits. amigurumi crochet patterns are very easy to make. as for the color, i arranged it according to myself. you can choose your own colors. however, i recommend that you take care to use compatible colors.
the teddy bear's clothes consist of 3 parts. shirt, hat and bag. when you crochet these three pieces, you will have a beautiful crochet teddy bear amigurumi. crochet teddy bears are no longer as popular as they used to be. because there are so many amigurumi crochet toys. that's why i don't plan to share amigurumi teddy bears for a while. but if you still want, you can write to me. this crochet teddy bear amigurumi complately free pattern.
