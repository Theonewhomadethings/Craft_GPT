hello friends, a few days ago i shared a bunny amigurumi pattern. today, i will share a teddy bear pattern made using almost the same pattern. as you know, teddy bear amigurumi patterns are among the most admired and sought-after patterns of all time. that's why these types of amigurumi patterns have been designed recently. the crochet teddy bear pattern has a few differences from the rabbit. first of all, of course, comes the ears. in addition, an extra muzzle part was added to the teddy bear. in this way, a teddy bear pattern was made by making a big difference. i really like the teddy bear pattern. it goes without saying that the pattern is free.
you can also download the amigurumi pattern as a pdf. the amigurumi pattern is a very easy pattern for a beginner. but the only part that can challenge you is the teddy bear's bow tie. after crocheting the last piece, your amigurumi will be ready. now, let's crochet the teddy bear amigurumi step by step.
