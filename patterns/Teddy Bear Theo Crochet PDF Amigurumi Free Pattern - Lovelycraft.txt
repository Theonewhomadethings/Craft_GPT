hello dear friends. today i will share a cute teddy bear amigurumi pattern. however, this crochet teddy bear pattern is quite difficult and advanced. we do not recommend for beginners. velvet thread was used as thread while making amigurumi. however, other types of thread will be required for some different parts. for example, the nose part and paws are made with threads of different colors and patterns. but you don't need to get too hung up on colors. you can choose the colors you want.
when you make the crochet teddy bear amigurumi, it will be approximately 34cm in size. that's a pretty big size for an amigurumi. so it might take a while to do. if you are someone who gets bored quickly, maybe you can do this bear at a time when your concentration is higher. i continue to share free amigurumi patterns. now let's work with teddy bear amigurumi crochet step by step.

assembling and decorating the bear.
after we have connected all the parts, we proceed to the assembly. sew on the details with a thin strong yarn in the color of the bear's yarn.
we sew the ears to the head.
place the ear on the side of the head. make sure that the ears are in a vertical line with the feet.
sew on the muzzle.
place the top edge of the muzzle just under the eyes. sew on with strong yarn. before you sew to the end, do not forget to fill the muzzle with filler.
sew the nose onto the muzzle.
determine the middle of the muzzle and sew on the nose.
sew on patches on the lower legs, stomach and head.
you can choose any place on the tummy, as well as on the head. in my description, i propose to do as follows:
on the tummy sew on the left side;
on the head near the right ear.
tightening.
next, you need to make a tightening on the eyes.
this requires a long needle and strong yarn.
we introduce the needle in the center at the bottom of the head, as close as possible to the seam of the joint between the head and the body. we bring it out near the right eye from the outside. at the bottom we leave the tail of the yarn, for which we will pull it. we introduce the needle from the back of the same eye and draw the muzzle at the bottom. we repeat the first step. lovelycraft.com. when the needle is near the eye, at the same time we pull (slightly, gently) by the tail of the yarn at the bottom and by the needle, we correct the crocheting with our hands, forming a tightening. we do this again so that the tightening holds.
we do the same from the side of the second (left) eye. after the tightening result suits you, we remove the needle from the bottom of the muzzle and tie a knot.
we continue to tighten. next, we need to bring our eyes slightly closer to each other. we introduce the needle from the bottom of the muzzle and withdraw it from the inside of the right eye.
insert the needle at the top of the right eye from the inside and draw it out at the top of the inside of the opposite (left) eye. we insert the needle at the bottom along the inner side of the left eye, draw it out on the right eye. slightly tighten the yarn, adjust the crocheting by hand.
pull the needle and yarn out from the bottom of the muzzle, tie a knot and hide both ends of the yarn in crocheting.
we embroider eyebrows with black yarn, a mouth on the face, and on all patches we make stitches. we also make stitches on the head, tummy and lower legs.
