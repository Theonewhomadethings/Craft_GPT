dear friends, welcome all of you to my amigurumi blog.
looking for a different crochet teddy bear amigurumi pattern? if the answer is yes, you have come to the right address. today i am sharing a wonderful crochet amigurumi teddy bear pattern. the name of this cute amigurumi is post bear sam. i must say it's a bit of a high end amigurumi. however, it is a little difficult to find such patterns for free.
yes dear friends. as i said at the beginning of the article, it is a really cute crochet bear pattern. moreover, it is a completely free pattern. in this model, i liked the hat and the very cute looking bag the most. although the hat is easy to make, the bag can be a bit of a challenge for you. however, if you follow the necessary instructions step by step, you will be able to make a great amigurumi in this way, i guarantee it.
