tip! you may have to adjust the eye placement depending on yarn and hook size you use. place your eyes between rounds 16 and 17. place the 1st eye before the 1st increase. where you placed your first stitch marker, one hole before that stitch marker. count 11 holes after that eye and place the 2nd after the last increase. stuff the head well. cut a long piece of yarn and remove the eyes. place the needle in the hole where the first eye was and thread the needle into a hole next to the eye hole. go back and forth between each eye hole repeating the process from the first eye. pull slightly on the yarn after going through each hole. do this about 3 times on each side until you reach the look you want. add some black eyeshadow around the eye for a dark look. there is a youtube video i have for extra help on this process.

helpful tips:
exact colors and brand of yarn used:
1. white: i love this yarn white
2. black: i love this yarn black
3. gray: i love this yarn gray mist
4. brown: big twist warm brown
you can use different eye and nose sizes. you might have to adjust the placements if you change the sizes.
you can use different hook sizes and weights of yarn. it will just change the size of your reaper and you might need to adjust eye and nose placement.
how you stuff matters! the type of stuffing you use, how you stuff, all this matters on how your reaper turns out. i prefer polyfil stuffing but you can use other types.
