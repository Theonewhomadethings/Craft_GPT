5 sc and 1 inc to end of row.
start doing upside down so that the stitches are on the right side.

insert the needle at the end of the green row at the beginning of the gray row on the head.
raise 25 chains back from the second making 1 medium double crochet in each chain, skip two stitches and secure with a slip stitch, and then raise 25 chains again and repeat until the end of the row. without finishing, resume a new sequence in the row under the head, forming a second row of hair. continue to the end of this row and finish off.

broom
10cm wooden toothpick: wrap a dark brown thread around the toothpick, add a few dots of glue to secure it.
once dry, cut several threads or acrylic yarn of approximately 7cm, glue them to the tip of the toothpick, more or less a finger.
(see the pictures)
tie about an inch from the end, wait for the glue to dry, then turn the strands upside down and tie again to give a more real broom feel. trim the strands to make it pretty.
congratulations, you have completed the amigurumi pattern.
