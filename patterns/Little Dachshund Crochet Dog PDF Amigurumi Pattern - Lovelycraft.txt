hello dear friends. today i am sharing a cute and realistic crochet dog pattern. this very cute amigurumi dog has a gorgeous dress. as i said before, it is very difficult to find dress amigurumi dolls. it is really difficult to make clothes especially suitable for animal amigurumi. generally, the dress is knitted as a whole with amigurumi. however, here the hoodie is crocheted separately.
the crochet dog amigurumi pattern is completely free. thank you very much darya for this pattern. the dominant color in the pattern is brown. if you wish, you can choose a different main color, but you should catch the color harmony well. now let's crochet dog amigurumi step by step.
