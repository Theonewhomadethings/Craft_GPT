dear friends, first of all, hello to everyone.
today i prepared a wonderful halloween pumpkin zombie amigurumi pattern for you. a big thank you to konyshevatoys for this pattern. the purpose of amigurumi is halloween. this kind of beautiful dolls are very loved every halloween. this cute crochet amigurumi pumpkin zombie is one of them.
this cute crochet zombie pumpkin amigurumi is made using velvet yarn. it has very vibrant colors. my personal opinion is the only thing missing is the mouth. the mouth part can be made a little more detailed. you can design it by adding your own comments. apart from that, i really liked the crochet hoodie detail. the disproportionate size of a separate eye reflects the distinctiveness of the amigurumi character. now let's move on to the step by step pattern instructions and start crocheting this cute pumpkin. stay tuned for more free amigurumi patterns.
