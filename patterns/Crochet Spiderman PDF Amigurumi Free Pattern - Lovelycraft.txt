hello dear friends.
today i'm going a little out of our concept. as you know, i was normally sharing animal and doll amigurumi patterns. but now i'm starting to share more comic book and movie characters. first of all, i want to share a spiderman pattern. the crochet spiderman pattern is a very realistic pattern. its size varies from approximately 15 to 20 cm. of course, this length is very related to the rope you use.
we start to make crochet spiderman feet, and then you can do it easily by following the steps step by step. i must say that it is not a difficult amigurumi pattern. especially for such characters. the most important part for you in spider-man amigurumi is to make the spider-man lines correctly. when you are careful in this part, everything will be over. now let's crochet spiderman amigurumi step by step.

assembly
from felt (foamiran), cut 4 parts of the eyes, 2 black and 2 white.
if you can't draw, you can print the picture or translate it from the screen (as i did)) so that the felt does not sag, go over the details with the overcasting seam. sew the white piece to the black stitches.
use a thin black yarn to embroider the web. if not, you can split the jeans yarn and use it.
we embroider the spider with black yarn glue or sew on the eyes. i glued it with hot glue.
your spiderman is ready!!!!
